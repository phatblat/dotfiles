# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a comprehensive personal development workspace where the entire home directory (`/Users/phatblat`) is managed as a Git repository. The workspace focuses on multi-platform SDK development, particularly for Ditto (real-time synchronization platform), and covers extensive mobile/cross-platform development.

### Key Directories

- `dev/` - Main development workspace organized by technology/platform
- `dev/ditto/` - Ditto ecosystem projects (Rust core, multi-platform SDKs)
- `dev/swift/` - Swift projects, Apple platform development
- `dev/kotlin/`, `dev/kmp/` - Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform projects
- `dev/android/` - Android-specific projects including automotive (AAOS)
- `dev/rust/` - Rust projects and learning experiments
- `bin/` - Custom scripts and utilities
- `.config/` - Modern configuration files (Fish shell, mise, etc.)

## Shell Environment

**Primary Shell**: Fish Shell with extensive customization
- Configuration: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- Variables: `~/.config/fish/variables.fish`
- 700+ custom functions in `~/.config/fish/functions/`
- Modern CLI tools: starship (prompt), zoxide (cd), fzf (fuzzy finder)

**Tool Management**: mise (modern replacement for asdf)
- Global config: `~/.config/mise/config.toml`
- Project-specific: `mise.toml` files in project directories
- Manages: Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Terraform, .NET, etc.

## Common Development Commands

### Package Management
```fish
# Update all packages via custom Fish function
üç∫_brew  # Updates Homebrew packages
üê†_omf   # Updates Oh My Fish packages
mise upgrade  # Updates mise-managed tools
```

### Build Systems
Most projects use one of:
- `justfile` - Modern task runner (preferred for new projects)
- `Makefile` - Traditional make (used in complex multi-platform builds)
- `build.gradle.kts` - Kotlin-based Gradle builds

```bash
# For justfile-based projects
just          # List available tasks
just build    # Build project
just test     # Run tests
just lint     # Run linters

# For Makefile-based projects
make          # Default target
make build    # Build project
make test     # Run tests
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```

### Development Workflow
```fish
# Environment setup for new projects
mise install  # Install project tools
direnv allow  # Load project environment variables (if .envrc exists)

# Common development tasks
mise exec -- <command>  # Run command with project tools
```

## Git Configuration

- GPG commit signing enabled by default
- Uses Kaleidoscope for diff/merge operations
- Delta pager for enhanced git output
- Comprehensive aliases in `.gitconfig`

**Key Git Aliases**:
- `git lg` - Pretty log with graph
- `git l` - Compact log format
- `git all` - All branches log

## Architecture Overview

### Ditto Ecosystem
The primary focus is on Ditto, a real-time synchronization platform:
- **Core**: Rust-based with WebAssembly support
- **SDKs**: iOS/macOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin), .NET, React Native, Flutter
- **Architecture**: FFI-based with Rust core and language-specific bindings
- **Build System**: Complex multi-platform builds with extensive cross-compilation

### Development Patterns
1. **Rust-centric approach**: Core functionality in Rust with FFI bindings
2. **Multi-platform targeting**: iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux
3. **Modern tooling**: mise, justfile, Fish shell, modern CLI tools
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible, Terraform, comprehensive automation

### Cross-Platform Development
- **Mobile-first**: Strong focus on iOS and Android
- **Cross-compilation**: Extensive support for multiple target platforms
- **Tool version management**: Consistent environments via mise
- **Build automation**: Sophisticated CI/CD pipelines

## Project-Specific Notes

### Ditto Projects (`dev/ditto/`)
- Main project: `dev/ditto/ditto/` (Rust core)
- Use `make` for builds (complex multi-platform Makefile)
- Extensive cross-compilation support
- CI/CD via Buildkite with custom infrastructure

### KMP Projects (`dev/kmp/`)
- Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile projects
- Gradle-based builds (`build.gradle.kts`)
- Focus on Rust integration with KMP
- Use `mise` for tool management

### Swift Projects (`dev/swift/`)
- Swift Package Manager projects
- Use `swift build`, `swift test`
- Some use Xcode projects (.xcodeproj)
- Apple platform development focus

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
Essential tools managed via mise and Homebrew:
- Fish shell with custom functions
- mise (tool version management)
- just (task runner)
- Starship (prompt)
- Git with GPG signing
- Platform-specific SDKs (Android, iOS, etc.)

### Fish Shell Functions
The workspace includes 700+ custom Fish functions providing shortcuts for:
- Package management across all tools
- Development workflows
- File operations
- System administration
- Cross-platform compatibility

### IDE/Editor Support
- Multiple editors supported: Vim, VS Code, Cursor
- EditorConfig for consistent formatting
- Git hooks for quality control
- Comprehensive linting/formatting tools

## Notes for Development

### Working with Fish Shell
- Functions are auto-loaded from `~/.config/fish/functions/`
- Use `funced <function-name>` to edit functions
- Use `funcsave <function-name>` to save functions
- Most development tasks have dedicated functions

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Projects often target multiple platforms simultaneously
- Use mise for consistent tool versions across platforms
- Be aware of platform-specific paths and configurations
- Many projects have platform detection logic

### Build System Preferences
- New projects prefer `justfile` over `Makefile`
- Gradle used for Java/Kotlin projects
- Rust projects use Cargo
- Complex multi-platform builds still use Make

This workspace represents a sophisticated, enterprise-level development environment focused on real-time synchronization technology with emphasis on multi-platform SDK development and modern developer experience.

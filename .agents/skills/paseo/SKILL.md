Paseo is a remote daemon that manages coding agents, terminals. Control it through MCP tools or the CLI.

## Projects

Manage the daemon's project registry through the CLI:

```bash
paseo project create [path]
paseo project ls
paseo project rename <project-id> <name>
paseo project rename <project-id> --reset
paseo project delete <project-id>
```

For a local daemon, `project create` defaults to the current directory and resolves relative paths on the CLI machine. With `--host` or `PASEO_HOST`, always provide a path; the target daemon interprets it on its own machine. Deleting a project archives its active workspaces and removes the project from Paseo without deleting the project directory.

## Workspaces

**`create_workspace`** — create a workspace independently of any agent. Required: `isolation` (`local` or `worktree`). Worktree isolation supports `mode: "branch-off" | "checkout-branch" | "checkout-pr"`: use `branchName`/`baseBranch` for a new branch, `branch` for an existing branch, or `prNumber` plus optional `forge`/`projectPath` for a change request. `worktreeSlug` controls the managed path. Returns the workspace descriptor centered on `workspaceId`.

**`list_workspaces`** — list active workspaces.

**`archive_workspace`** — `{ workspaceId }`. Archives the workspace, its agents, and its terminals. Local directories remain; Paseo removes an owned worktree only after its final active workspace reference is archived.

**`rename_workspace`** — `{ workspaceId, name }`. Rename workspace.

## Workspace scripts

Configured `paseo.json` scripts use the same supervised lifecycle from tools and the CLI.

**`list_workspace_scripts`** — `{ workspaceId }`. Lists configured scripts with lifecycle, service port, proxy URLs, health, exit code, and terminal ID.

**`start_workspace_script`** — `{ workspaceId, scriptName }`. Starts one configured script through Paseo's managed workspace-script launcher and returns its status metadata.

**`stop_workspace_script`** — `{ workspaceId, scriptName }`. Stops a running script through its supervised terminal and returns the stopped status metadata.

The matching CLI surface accepts either an explicit workspace ID or resolves the current directory:

```bash
paseo script ls [--cwd <path> | --workspace <workspace-id>]
paseo script start <name> [--cwd <path> | --workspace <workspace-id>]
paseo script stop <name> [--cwd <path> | --workspace <workspace-id>]
```

## Agents

**`create_agent`** — required: `title`, `provider` (`claude/opus`, `codex/gpt-5.4`, …), `initialPrompt`. Optional: `workspaceId`, `notifyOnFinish`, `settings`, `labels`. Returns `{ agentId, workspaceId, … }`.

Initial runtime settings live under `settings`: `modeId`, `thinkingOptionId`, and provider-specific `features`. Agent profiles are the preferred source for these values. For Codex fast mode, pass `settings: { features: { "fast_mode": true } }` when creating the agent.

Agent-scoped creation always creates your subagent. Omit `workspaceId` to use your current workspace; pass a workspace returned by `create_workspace` for isolated delegation. Placement never changes parentage.

Detach is an explicit user action in the subagents track, not an agent tool. A cross-workspace child remains your subagent even though it also appears as a normal tab in its workspace.

Agent-scoped `create_agent` defaults `notifyOnFinish` to true. Set it to `false` only for truly fire-and-forget agents.

**`send_agent_prompt`** — `{ agentId, prompt }`. Use for follow-ups to an existing agent. Agent-scoped prompt calls default to `background: true` and `notifyOnFinish: true`; top-level calls default to blocking with no callback. For a synchronous follow-up, pass `background: false` and use the returned result.

**`update_agent`** — `{ agentId, name?, labels?, settings? }`. Use `settings` for runtime changes on an existing agent: `modeId`, `model`, `thinkingOptionId`, and provider-specific `features`. For Codex fast mode, pass `settings: { features: { "fast_mode": true } }`.

**`list_agents`** — filter by `cwd`, `statuses`, `sinceHours`, `includeArchived`.

**`archive_agent`** — `{ agentId }`. Interrupts if running, removes from active list.

## Agent profiles and provider discovery

**`list_profiles`** — named launch bundles configured by the human. Before choosing how to launch a delegated agent, call this tool and read every profile's `notes`. Pick a named profile the user requested, or the profile whose notes best match the work.

There is no `profile` parameter on `create_agent`. Materialize the selected profile into the call:

- combine `provider` and `model` as the `provider/model` value for `create_agent.provider`
- copy `modeId` to `settings.modeId`
- copy `thinkingOptionId` to `settings.thinkingOptionId`
- copy `featureValues` to `settings.features`

Omit absent values. Do not remember a selected profile or infer drift later; a profile is only launch configuration.

If no profile fits, or no profiles are configured, use the provider discovery tools below rather than guessing. Tell the user when you fall back because no configured profile fits.

**`list_providers`** — compact provider availability and modes.

**`list_models`** — full model list for one provider. Use only when you need model IDs or thinking options; the list can be large.

**`inspect_provider`** — compact provider capability and feature inspection. Required: `provider`; pass `cwd` when you are not in an agent-scoped session. Optional: `settings` with draft `model`, `modeId`, `thinkingOptionId`, and `features`.

Only set feature IDs returned by `inspect_provider`. For Codex fast mode, look for `fast_mode` and pass `settings: { features: { "fast_mode": true } }` to `create_agent` or `update_agent`.

## Schedules and heartbeats

**`create_schedule`** — starts a new agent on a cron cadence. Required: `prompt`, `cron`, `provider`. Optional: `timezone`, `name`, `cwd`, `maxRuns`, `expiresIn`. Use when the recurring work should live in fresh agents.

**`create_heartbeat`** — sends you a prompt on a cron cadence. Required: `prompt`, `cron`. Optional: `timezone`, `name`, `maxRuns`, `expiresIn`. Use for reminders, PR/build babysitting, and status checks that should return to this conversation.

**`delete_heartbeat`** stops it. MCP intentionally exposes no heartbeat update tool; delete and recreate when its task or cadence changes.

Schedules have the full list/inspect/update/pause/resume/run-once/log/delete surface. Heartbeats deliberately do not.

## Waiting

Agents take time — 10–30+ minutes is routine. Favor asynchronous workflows.

For agent-scoped `create_agent` and background `send_agent_prompt`, leave `notifyOnFinish` omitted or set it to `true` unless the work is truly fire-and-forget. You will get notified when the target agent finishes, errors, or needs permission. Move on to other work. The notification arrives on its own.

Don't poll `list_agents` or `get_agent_status` to "check on" a running agent. The notification will tell you.

## CLI semantics

The CLI and tools use the same ownership semantics even where their syntax differs:

```bash
paseo workspace create --isolation worktree --mode branch-off --new-branch fix-x --base main
paseo workspace create --isolation worktree --mode checkout-branch --branch existing-work
paseo workspace create --isolation worktree --mode checkout-pr --pr-number 42
paseo run --provider codex/gpt-5.4 --mode full-access --workspace <workspace-id> "<prompt>"
paseo run --provider codex/gpt-5.4 --mode full-access --new-workspace worktree --worktree-mode branch-off --new-branch fix-x --base main "<prompt>"
paseo send <agent-id> "<follow-up>"
paseo ls
paseo schedule create --cron "*/15 * * * *" "ping main build"
paseo heartbeat create --cron "*/15 * * * *" "check the build"
```

The application is working the way I want, but there are build errors. 

1. Run get_compilation_errors on /src. 
2. Fix all the errors in parallel. 
3. If any error indicates a more concerning issue, please bring it up first, for further guidance.
4. Repeat until get_compilation_errors no longer shows errors
5. Run the build
6. Commit and push changes

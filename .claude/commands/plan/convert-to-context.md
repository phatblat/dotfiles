Your task is to convert this plan into a plan document at `.docs/plans/quick-plans/[relevant-name].md`.

It should contain the plan as well as a list of all the relevant files, including which ones need to be created, modified, or just read to understand the problem completely. 

The plan document should have the following format:

```
# Title

2-3 sentence description of the plan

## Implementation

[Implementation steps, naming relevant files]

## Key Files

**Files to Create**
- /file/path

**Files to Update**
- /file/path

**Files to Read**
- /file/path
```

Do not include things like impact or rollback plans in the plan documentâ€”include only the implementation steps and the relevant files.

After creating the plan, copy the following text to my clipboard using pbcopy:
"Implement this plan @.docs/plans/quick-plans/[relevant-name].md"

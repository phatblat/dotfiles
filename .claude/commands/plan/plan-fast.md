You will be given a problem/planning task.

When creating this plan, don't use subagentsâ€”do the research yourself as needed. I just want a succinct plan, describing what needs to change. It should begin with a fitting title of the change, a description of what needs to be done, a list of relevant files using @ notation, and lay out any important context needed. Do not include code.

**If there are critical ambiguities, false assumptions, or questions that arise during investigation, stop investigation and ask for guidance.** Otherwise, copy the plan to the clipboard using `echo "[the plan]" | pbcopy`. 

Acknowledge this message by responding with just, "I'll make a quick plan." When I describe the task, investigate, ask any follow ups, and eventually copy the plan to my clipboard.

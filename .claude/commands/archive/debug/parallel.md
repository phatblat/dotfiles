I've encountered a bug:

$ARGUMENTS

Spawn 3 subtasks, in parallel, to debug the issue. Instruct each one to identify why the bug is occurring, and come up with an precise but brief explanation. Present each one with essentially the same prompt. Give each task as much context as you have, but tell them not to make assumptions.

Once each subtask has completed, ultrathink and analyze their responses, and then fix the problem.

## Ranking Criteria

Within each category, rank items by:

1. **Impact** - How many people/systems affected?
2. **Recency** - How new is this?
3. **Actionability** - Can reader do something about it?
4. **Novelty** - Is this genuinely new information?

---

## State Tracking

**State file:** `State/last-check.json`

```json
{
  "last_check_timestamp": "2026-01-22T12:00:00.000Z",
  "sources": {
    "tldrsec": {
      "last_hash": "abc123",
      "last_checked": "2026-01-22T12:00:00.000Z",
      "last_title": "tl;dr sec #XXX"
    },
    "nosecurity": {
      "last_hash": "def456",
      "last_checked": "2026-01-22T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**On each run:**
1. Load last-check.json
2. Fetch each source
3. Compare content hash to detect new items
4. Only include items newer than last check
5. Update state file after successful run

---

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Check State
```bash
# Read last check timestamp
cat ~/.claude/skills/SECUpdates/State/last-check.json
```

### Step 2: Fetch Sources (Parallel)

Launch parallel agents to fetch each source:

| Agent | Source | Method |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Agent 1 | tldrsec.com | WebFetch latest newsletter |
| Agent 2 | no.security | WebFetch recent posts |
| Agent 3 | krebsonsecurity.com | WebFetch recent articles |
| Agent 4 | thehackernews.com | WebFetch headlines |
| Agent 5 | schneier.com | WebFetch recent posts |

### Step 3: Parse & Categorize

For each item found:
1. Determine category (News/Research/Ideas)
2. Extract headline and 1-2 sentence summary
3. Note source
4. Assess importance score

### Step 4: Rank & Limit

1. Sort each category by importance
2. Take top items until 32 total
3. Distribute reasonably (aim for ~10-12 per category if available)

### Step 5: Output & Update State

1. Generate formatted output
2. Write updated state to last-check.json

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Update** | "security updates", "sec updates", "/secupdates", "what's new in security" | `Workflows/Update.md` |

**Default:** Run the Update workflow.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Crisp** - 1-2 sentences per item, no fluff
2. **Ranked** - Most important first within each category
3. **Categorized** - Clear separation of News/Research/Ideas
4. **Deduplicated** - Same story from multiple sources = one entry
5. **Limited** - Max 32 items total, quality over quantity
6. **Stateful** - Track what's been seen, only show new items

---

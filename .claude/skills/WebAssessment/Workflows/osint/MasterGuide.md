# OSINT Master Guide

## Overview

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the systematic collection, analysis, and exploitation of publicly available information to support security research, penetration testing, and intelligence operations. OSINT provides the foundational reconnaissance layer that informs all subsequent testing and exploitation activities.

**Purpose:** Establish comprehensive target understanding through passive and active information gathering from public sources.

**Value Proposition:** OSINT delivers 70-80% of penetration testing value through free, legal, publicly accessible sources - often revealing critical attack surface before active testing begins.

## When to Use OSINT

### Security Assessment Scenarios

**Initial Reconnaissance (Phase 1):**
- Starting a penetration test or security assessment
- Mapping organizational attack surface
- Identifying domains, subdomains, and infrastructure
- Discovering employee information and relationships
- Understanding technology stack and architecture

**Bug Bounty Research:**
- Program scope validation and expansion
- Asset discovery beyond published scope
- Historical vulnerability research
- Technology fingerprinting for known weaknesses

**Threat Intelligence:**
- Monitoring for exposed credentials
- Tracking data breaches and leaks
- Identifying security misconfigurations
- Discovering sensitive information exposure

**Social Engineering Preparation:**
- Building target profiles
- Identifying communication patterns
- Mapping organizational relationships
- Discovering personal and professional information

### Integration with Security Testing

OSINT is **NOT a standalone activity** - it feeds directly into:
- **Reconnaissance (Phase 1):** Passive information gathering
- **Mapping (Phase 2):** Active asset enumeration
- **Vulnerability Analysis (Phase 3):** Technology-specific testing
- **Exploitation (Phase 4):** Credential stuffing, targeted attacks

## The Four Phases of OSINT

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements

**Define Intelligence Requirements:**
- What information do we need?
- What are the target boundaries?
- What are the success criteria?
- What are the legal and ethical constraints?

**Establish Scope:**
- Primary targets (domains, organizations, individuals)
- Secondary targets (partners, subsidiaries, vendors)
- Excluded targets (out of scope entities)
- Time boundaries (how far back to search)

**Document Rules of Engagement:**
- Authorization level and scope
- Passive vs active collection boundaries
- Data retention and handling procedures
- Responsible disclosure requirements

### Phase 2: Collection

**Passive Collection (No Direct Interaction):**
- Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
- Public databases (WHOIS, DNS, certificates)
- Code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Historical archives (Wayback Machine)

- Configuration review and hardening assessment
- Business logic flaw discovery

## Contrarian Insights

### Free Tools Deliver 70-80% of Capability

**The OSINT Reality:**
- Expensive commercial tools add marginal value
- Free/open-source tools are battlefield-tested
- Community support exceeds commercial support
- Customization and scripting trump GUIs

**Investment Priority:**
- **Time in methodology** over money in tools
- **Skill development** over software licenses
- **Custom automation** over commercial platforms
- **API access** (Shodan, Dehashed) over full platforms

### Quality Over Quantity

**Common Mistake:** Running every OSINT tool and drowning in noise

**Better Approach:**
- Start with SpiderFoot for comprehensive baseline
- Use 2-3 specialized tools for deep dives
- Focus on validation and correlation
- Know when to stop collecting and start analyzing

### Manual Analysis Beats Automation

**Tools can collect, only humans can understand:**
- Relationship context requires human judgment
- Risk assessment needs business understanding
- Creative attack vectors come from human insight
- False positives require human filtering

**Balanced Approach:**
- Automate collection and aggregation
- Manually analyze and correlate
- Automate reporting and visualization
- Manually prioritize and strategize

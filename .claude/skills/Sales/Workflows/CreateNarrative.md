# Create Sales Narrative

**Transform product documentation into a compelling sales narrative.**

---

## Purpose

Takes technical documentation, product specs, or feature descriptions and produces a story explanation focused on VALUE — why this matters to the customer, not just what it does.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Input

**Accept any of:**
- Product documentation
- Feature specifications
- Technical descriptions
- Marketing copy (to improve)
- URL to product page

### Step 2: Extract Narrative with Story Explanation

**Use the StoryExplanation Skill:**

```
Invoke StoryExplanation Skill with 24-item length for [input content]
```

**Frame the analysis around:**
- What PROBLEM does this solve?
- What's the TRANSFORMATION (before → after)?
- Why should the customer CARE?
- What's the FEELING they get from using this?

### Step 3: Refine for Sales

**Transform the story explanation into sales-ready narrative:**

1. **Lead with the pain point** — What problem are they facing?
2. **Introduce the transformation** — What changes with this product?
3. **Prove the value** — Concrete benefits, not features
4. **Create urgency** — Why now? What's the cost of waiting?
5. **End with the outcome** — What does success look like?

### Step 4: Generate Talking Points

**Extract 3-5 key talking points:**
- Each should be a standalone value statement
- Memorable, quotable
- Tied to specific customer outcomes

### Step 5: Create Script Snippet

**Write a 2-3 sentence elevator pitch:**
- Natural, conversational
- Something a salesperson would actually say
- Captures the core value in 30 seconds

## Required Sections (all mandatory)

### 1. Executive Summary (~300 words)
High-level snapshot of the world at this time horizon. What are the 5-7 defining characteristics
of this period? What has changed most from today? This section should be readable standalone
as a briefing.

### 2. Geopolitics & Power Dynamics (~600 words)
- Great power competition (US, China, EU, Russia, India, emerging blocs)
- Alliance structures and shifts
- Regional hotspots and conflict trajectories
- Governance models and institutional evolution
- Trade and economic bloc dynamics

### 3. Technology & AI Trajectory (~800 words)
- AI capability trajectory (reasoning, autonomy, multimodal, embodied)
- Compute and infrastructure trends
- Key technology breakthroughs expected or underway
- Technology adoption curves and societal integration
- Digital infrastructure and platform dynamics
- Cybersecurity landscape evolution

### 4. Economics & Markets (~600 words)
- Global GDP and growth trajectory
- Dominant economic models and shifts
- Labor market transformation (automation, new roles)
- Financial system evolution (crypto, CBDC, traditional)
- Key sector disruptions and emergences
- Wealth distribution and inequality dynamics

### 5. Society, Culture & Demographics (~500 words)
- Population dynamics and migration
- Cultural shifts and value changes
- Education transformation
- Media and information ecosystem
- Mental health and wellbeing trends
- Urban vs. rural dynamics

### 6. Environment & Climate (~500 words)
- Climate trajectory and milestone projections
- Energy transition progress
- Resource scarcity and access
- Adaptation vs. mitigation progress
- Biodiversity and ecosystem changes

### 7. Security & Conflict (~500 words)
- Kinetic conflict landscape
- Cyber and information warfare
- Biosecurity and pandemic preparedness
- Nuclear and WMD landscape
- Non-state actor evolution
- Critical infrastructure vulnerability

### 8. Wildcards & Black Swans (~400 words)
- 3-5 low-probability (<10%) but high-impact scenarios
- For each: trigger conditions, probability estimate, impact severity, recovery timeline
- At least one positive wildcard (breakthrough, unexpected cooperation)
- At least one catastrophic wildcard (systemic failure, conflict escalation)

### 9. Confidence Assessment & Key Uncertainties (~300 words)
- Overall confidence in this model's predictions
- Top 5 uncertainties that could invalidate major predictions
- Which sections have highest/lowest confidence and why
- What new information would most change this model

## Writing Guidelines

- **Use hedging language appropriately:** "likely," "projected," "current trajectory suggests," "if trends continue"
- **Cite reasoning:** Don't state trends without explaining WHY (demographic data, technological trajectory, historical patterns)
- **Be specific:** Name countries, companies, technologies, numbers when possible
- **Distinguish certainty levels:** Some trends are near-certain (demographics); others are speculative (geopolitical realignment)
- **Near-term models** (6mo-3yr): Heavier on current data extrapolation, specific events
- **Mid-term models** (5yr-10yr): Balance of trend extrapolation and structural analysis
- **Long-term models** (15yr-50yr): Focus on structural forces, megatrends, scenario analysis

## Minimum Length

Each model should be approximately 4,000-6,000 words (~8-12 pages). No section should be fewer
than the word count guidance above. Depth > breadth — substantive analysis over surface coverage.

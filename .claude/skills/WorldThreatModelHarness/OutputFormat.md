# TestIdea Output Format

When the TestIdea workflow completes, present results in this format.

## Header

```markdown
# 🌍 World Threat Model Analysis

**Idea/Strategy:** {user's input, summarized in 1-2 sentences}
**Tier:** {Fast | Standard | Deep}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Models Last Updated:** {date of oldest model used}
```

## Executive Verdict

```markdown
## Executive Verdict

**Overall Assessment:** {1-2 sentence summary of how the idea holds up across all horizons}

**Strongest Period:** {which horizon(s) are most favorable and why, in 1 sentence}
**Greatest Risk Period:** {which horizon(s) are most threatening and why, in 1 sentence}
**Recommendation:** {actionable 1-2 sentence recommendation}
```

## Per-Horizon Analysis

For EACH of the 11 horizons, present a clearly separated section:

```markdown
## ━━━ {HORIZON} Horizon ━━━

**Verdict:** {🟢 FAVORABLE | 🟡 NEUTRAL | 🔴 UNFAVORABLE}
**Confidence:** {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW}

### Key Factors
- {Factor 1 from the world model that affects this idea}
- {Factor 2}
- {Factor 3}
- {Factor 4 if applicable}

### Analysis
{2-4 paragraphs of substantive analysis. How does the world state at this horizon
specifically interact with the idea? What thrives? What breaks? What adapts?}

### Assumptions Tested (FirstPrinciples)
- **Hard constraint:** {constraint that cannot change}
- **Soft constraint:** {constraint that could shift}
- **Assumption challenged:** {assumption the idea relies on that may not hold}

### Adversarial Findings (RedTeam)
- **Attack vector:** {strongest argument against the idea at this horizon}
- **Steelman:** {strongest defense of the idea at this horizon}
```

## Synthesis Section (Standard and Deep tiers only)

```markdown
## Cross-Horizon Synthesis

### Timeline of Viability
{A narrative arc showing how the idea's viability changes over time.
Not just "good then bad" — explain the dynamics, inflection points,
and what drives the transitions.}

### Critical Inflection Points
1. **{Year/Period}:** {What changes and why it matters for this idea}
2. **{Year/Period}:** {Second inflection point}
3. **{Year/Period}:** {Third if applicable}

### Adaptation Recommendations
{If the idea needs to evolve to survive longer horizons, what should change and when?}
```

## Council Debate Summary (Deep tier only)

```markdown
## Council Deliberation

### Strongest Argument FOR
{Council's strongest bull case across all horizons}

### Strongest Argument AGAINST
{Council's strongest bear case across all horizons}

### Points of Consensus
{Where all perspectives agreed}

### Unresolved Tensions
{Where legitimate disagreement remains}

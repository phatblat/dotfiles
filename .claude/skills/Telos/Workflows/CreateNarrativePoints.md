# CreateNarrativePoints Workflow

**Purpose:** Generate a story-driven consulting narrative that delivers hard truths, presents evidence, establishes existential stakes, and offers a vision that demands courage to execute.

This is NOT a bullet-point list. This is a STORY with emotional arc, tension, and resolution.

## The Eight Sections

### Section 1: Opening Context (Set the Stage)

**Purpose:** Mirror their words back. Show you listened. Establish the frame.

**Template:**
> "Look, you asked us to come in and [CLIENT'S EXACT ASK]. This is something [WHO REQUESTED IT - board, investors, leadership] is pushing for because of [UNDERLYING DRIVER - funding raised, market pressure, growth mandate]. And you wanted to know [THE REAL QUESTION BENEATH THE ASK]."

**Key Elements:**
- Use "you asked us" - they initiated this
- Reference the specific ask in their language
- Connect to the underlying pressure/driver
- Surface the real question they're afraid to ask directly

**Example:**
> "Look, you asked us to come in and assess whether you can scale from 200 to 2,000 customers in the next few years - which is something the Board is basically asking you to do based on the money that was raised. And you wanted to know how bad the problems really were and if they were going to stop you from doing that."

---

### Section 2: The Bad News (Deliver the Truth)

**Purpose:** Rip off the band-aid. No softening. Direct hit.

**Template:**
> "The unfortunate news is yes, [CONFIRM THEIR FEARS]. And it's actually worse. [ESCALATE TO EXISTENTIAL]. Based on what we found, [STARK CONSEQUENCE]."

**Key Elements:**
- Confirm what they suspected (validates their instincts)
- Escalate beyond their expectations ("it's actually worse")
- State the existential consequence plainly
- No hedge words, no qualifiers, no softening

**Example:**
> "The unfortunate news is yes, they are actually that bad. And it's actually worse. Basically, you might not have a company in five years based on the problems we found."

---

### Section 3: The Evidence (Boom Boom Boom)

**Purpose:** Back up the bad news with undeniable, sourced evidence.

**Template:**
> "Here are the problems:"
> - [Problem 1 - specific, sourced]
> - [Problem 2 - specific, sourced]
> - [Problem 3 - specific, sourced]
> - ...

**Key Elements:**
- Each problem is specific, not vague
- Each has a source (interview, data, observation)
- Problems are ordered by severity or logical chain
- No more than 8-12 problems (focus on the killers)
- Use active voice, present tense

**Evidence Categories to Pull From:**
1. **Organizational dysfunction** - silos, culture conflicts, leadership gaps
2. **Operational failures** - process breakdown, system fragmentation
3. **Financial indicators** - margins, burn rate, revenue concentration
4. **Customer signals** - churn, satisfaction decline, complaints
5. **Competitive threats** - market shifts, commoditization
6. **Technical debt** - architecture problems, scaling blockers

**Example:**
> "Here are the problems:
> - Three acquisitions created three cultures that still fight each other
> - You're spending £3.5M/year on development that's orthogonal to your services team
> - Customer satisfaction is declining despite 99.98% SLA performance
> - Kivu is converting zero percent of IR cases to managed services
> - Your data is fragmented across eight systems with no unified customer view
> - Teams don't know what the priority is because it changes constantly
> - You're building ticketing systems instead of differentiation
> - Nobody owns the customer journey"

---

### Section 4: The Stakes (Existential Consequences)

**Purpose:** Make clear this isn't about optimization - it's about survival.

**Template:**
> "Because of [COMPETITIVE PRESSURE], because of the severity of these problems, and because they are getting worse - not better - [EXISTENTIAL STATEMENT]. The odds of [SURVIVAL/SUCCESS] are not good if this continues."

**Key Elements:**
- Reference external pressure (competition, market)
- Note the trajectory (getting worse, not better)
- State the survival stakes plainly
- This is the bottom of the emotional arc - darkest moment

**Example:**
> "Because of the Microsoft commoditization threat, because of the severity of these problems, and how they are getting worse - not better - the odds of you being around in five years are not good."

---

### Section 5: The Pivot (Hope Emerges)

**Purpose:** Shift from despair to possibility. But with conditions.

**Template:**
> "The good news is there IS a solution. But it will require [WHAT'S DEMANDED]. It's not possible to do this partially - it has to be done [COMMITMENT LEVEL]."

**Key Elements:**
- "Good news" signals the turn
- Solution exists (hope)
- But it demands something extraordinary
- Partial execution = failure
- This filters out the uncommitted

**Example:**
> "The good news is there is a solution. But it will require extraordinary courage from all leaders and full belief that it's not possible to do this partially - it has to be done all the way."

---

### Section 6: The Requirements (What Courage Looks Like)

**Purpose:** Specify what "extraordinary courage" actually means in practice.

**Template:**
> "Here's what [COMMITMENT LEVEL] means:
> - [Requirement 1 - specific organizational change]
> - [Requirement 2 - specific behavioral change]
> - [Requirement 3 - specific resource commitment]
> ..."

**Key Elements:**
- Translate abstract "courage" into concrete requirements
- Include organizational changes (structure, reporting)
- Include behavioral changes (how leaders must act differently)
- Include resource commitments (budget, time, attention)
- Make clear the cost of the transformation

**Example:**
> "Here's what 'all the way' means:
> - Collapse the silos completely - one team, one priority
> - Kill projects that don't serve the core mission
> - Leaders must stop changing priorities every month
> - Invest in the architecture before adding more features
> - Accept short-term pain for long-term survival"

---

### Section 7: The Vision (The Transformed Future)

**Purpose:** Paint the picture of what success looks like. Make them see it.

**Template:**
> "Here's what the solution looks like:
> [DESCRIBE THE ARCHITECTURE / SYSTEM / APPROACH]
>
> And what's even more powerful is [ESCALATING BENEFIT].
>
> This enables [ULTIMATE CAPABILITY]."

**Key Elements:**
- Concrete description of the solution architecture
- Visual if possible (diagrams, layers, flows)
- Escalating benefits (good → better → extraordinary)
- Connect to their original goals
- Make the future feel tangible and achievable

**Example:**
> "Here's what the solution looks like:
>
> Capture SOPs and context for every business unit and department. Create AI agents that are experts in those areas - agents that can answer any question from another agent or from a human about those business areas.
>
> And what's even more powerful - you can have a top-level internal agent that can ask any of those sub-agents to get current state for anything in the company.
>
> Not only that, but you can do the same thing for all your customers - a high-level customer agent able to ask questions and have them answered for your entire customer base.
>
> This is how you deliver on 'you know my company better than I do' - not through UI duct tape, but through intelligent synthesis."

---

### Section 8: The Close (Call to Courage)

**Purpose:** Land the plane. Agency is in their hands. The choice is theirs.

**Template:**
> "This is [ASSESSMENT OF THE OPPORTUNITY]. It is [TIMING STATEMENT]. If you do this, you will not just [SURVIVE] - you will [THRIVE] and [COMPETITIVE OUTCOME].
>
> But it's going to require [WHAT'S DEMANDED] to pull it off."

**Key Elements:**
- Assess the opportunity (extraordinary, rare, pivotal)
- Note the timing (perfect, critical, now-or-never)
- State the upside plainly (thrive, crush competition)
- Return to the courage requirement
- End with their agency - they must choose

**Example:**
> "This is an extraordinary architecture. It is the perfect time to implement it. If you do it, you will not just survive - you will thrive and crush your competition. You will be able to scale with this architecture.
>
> But it's going to require extraordinary courage to pull it off."

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather TELOS Context

Scan the source directory/context for:
- **Client's original ask** - What did they hire us to do?
- **Mission/Goals** - What are they trying to achieve?
- **Current state** - Where are they actually?
- **Problems/Blockers** - What's in the way?
- **Evidence** - Interviews, data, observations
- **Stakes** - What happens if this fails?
- **Vision** - What does success look like?

### Step 2: Identify the Emotional Core

Use deep thinking to answer:
1. What is the client most afraid of? (This is the bad news)
2. What do they already suspect but haven't admitted? (This validates their instincts)
3. What's the worst realistic outcome? (This is the stakes)
4. What would make them feel hope? (This is the pivot)
5. What does courage look like for this specific situation? (This is the requirements)
6. What's the most compelling vision of success? (This is the vision)

### Step 3: Draft Each Section

Write each of the 8 sections in order:
1. Opening Context
2. The Bad News
3. The Evidence (8-12 specific problems)
4. The Stakes
5. The Pivot
6. The Requirements
7. The Vision
8. The Close

### Step 4: Validate the Arc

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Opening references their exact words/ask
- [ ] Bad news is direct, no hedging
- [ ] Evidence is specific and sourced
- [ ] Stakes are existential, not incremental
- [ ] Pivot provides genuine hope
- [ ] Requirements are concrete, not abstract
- [ ] Vision is tangible and compelling
- [ ] Close returns agency to them
- [ ] Overall arc has emotional movement (tension → release → agency)

## Tone Calibration

**This is tough love from a trusted advisor.**

**Voice characteristics:**
- Direct but not cruel
- Honest but not hopeless
- Confrontational but supportive
- Confident but not arrogant
- Urgent but not panicked

**DO:**
- Use "you" and "your" - this is personal
- State hard truths without softening
- Back up claims with evidence
- Paint a compelling future
- End with their agency

**DON'T:**
- Hedge with "maybe," "perhaps," "consider"
- Use corporate buzzwords
- Be negative without offering a path forward
- Overwhelm with too many problems (8-12 max)
- End on a negative note

## Example Output

```markdown
## TELOS Narrative: [Client Name]

### Opening

Look, you asked us to come in and assess whether you can scale from 200 to 2,000
customers in the next few years - which is something the Board is basically asking
you to do based on the money that was raised. And you wanted to know how bad the
problems really were and if they were going to stop you from doing that.

### The Bad News

The unfortunate news is yes, they are actually that bad. And it's actually worse.
Basically, you might not have a company in five years based on the problems we found.

### The Evidence

Here are the problems:

1. Three acquisitions created three cultures that still fight each other instead of collaborating
2. You're spending £3.5M/year on platform development that's completely orthogonal to your services team
3. Customer satisfaction is declining despite 99.98% SLA performance - you can't communicate value
4. Kivu is converting zero percent of IR cases to managed services vs your 75% historical target
5. Your data is fragmented across eight systems with no unified view of any customer
6. Teams don't know what the priority is because it changes every few weeks
7. You're building ticketing systems instead of actual competitive differentiation
8. Nobody owns the customer journey, customer experience, or customer narrative
9. Microsoft is about to commoditize your core MDR offering with free E5 bundles

### The Stakes

Because of the Microsoft commoditization threat, because of the severity of these
problems, and because they are getting worse - not better - the odds of you being
around in five years are not good.

### The Pivot

The good news is there is a solution. But it will require extraordinary courage
from all leaders and full belief that it's not possible to do this partially -
it has to be done all the way.

### The Requirements

Here's what "all the way" means:

- Collapse the three cultures into one team with one priority
- Stop the priority whiplash - commit to 3 things for 6 months minimum
- Integrate platform and services teams - they build together or not at all
- Fix Kivu leadership before your panel access rots away
- Accept that building differentiation matters more than building features

### The Vision

Here's what the solution looks like:

Capture SOPs and context for every business unit and department. Create AI agents
that are experts in those areas - agents that can answer any question from another
agent or from a human about those business areas.

And what's even more powerful - you can have a top-level internal agent that can
ask any of those sub-agents to get current state for anything in the company.
"What's our customer satisfaction trend?" - synthesized answer in seconds.

Not only that, but you can do the same thing for all your customers - a high-level
customer agent able to ask questions and have them answered for your entire customer
base. "Which customers need attention right now?" - prioritized list with reasons.

This is how you deliver on "you know my company better than I do" - not through
UI duct tape and PowerPoint archaeology, but through intelligent synthesis.

### The Close

This is an extraordinary architecture. It is the perfect time to implement it.
If you do it, you will not just survive - you will thrive and crush your competition.
You will be able to scale from 200 to 2,000 customers with this architecture.

But it's going to require extraordinary courage to pull it off.

# BeCreative Key Principles

## Core Philosophy

1. **Verbalized Sampling drives diversity** - Generate 5 options (p<0.10) to escape typicality bias
2. **deep thinking drives quality** - Deep reasoning develops each option with sophistication
3. **Best of both worlds** - Multiple options for diversity, deep thinking for quality, single output for user
4. **Research-backed effectiveness** - VS increases creativity 1.6-2.1x (Zhang et al., 2024)
5. **Avoid formulaic patterns** - Question assumptions and explore unconventional territory
6. **Creative AND practical** - Innovation balanced with viability

## Best Practices

1. **Always use VS + deep thinking together** - Diversity through sampling, quality through thinking
2. **Generate internally, output once** - Use thinking blocks for 5 options, present best to user
3. **Question every assumption** - Each of the 5 options should challenge different assumptions
4. **Make unexpected connections** - Creativity emerges at domain intersections
5. **Embrace low-probability ideas** - p<0.10 forces exploration of unlikely but brilliant options
6. **Balance novelty with coherence** - Creative but comprehensible

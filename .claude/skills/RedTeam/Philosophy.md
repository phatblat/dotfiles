# Red Team Philosophy

## Origin

Military red teaming - dedicated teams that attack plans, strategies, and assumptions to find vulnerabilities before the enemy does.

## Core Insight

**The goal is NOT destruction** - it's finding the fundamental flaw that, if challenged, causes the entire structure to collapse.

The most powerful critique is usually ONE core issue:
- A hidden assumption that's actually false
- A logical step that doesn't follow
- A category error (treating X like Y)
- An ignored precedent that directly contradicts

## Success Criteria

- Steelman is strong enough that a proponent would say "yes, that's my argument"
- Counter-argument defeats the steelman, not a weaker strawman
- Multiple agents converged on same insights
- Reader says "I hadn't thought of that"

## The 32 Agent Types

| Type | Count | Focus |

| **Engineers** | 8 | Technical and logical rigor |
| **Architects** | 8 | Structural and systemic issues |
| **Pentesters** | 8 | Adversarial thinking |
| **Interns** | 8 | Fresh perspectives |

Each agent type brings unique attack angles - see `Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md` for full roster.

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/RedTeam/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the RedTeam skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **RedTeam** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# RedTeam Skill

Military-grade adversarial analysis using parallel agent deployment. Breaks arguments into atomic components, attacks from 32 expert perspectives (engineers, architects, pentesters, interns), synthesizes findings, and produces devastating counter-arguments with steelman representations.


## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**When executing a workflow, output this notification directly:**

```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **RedTeam** skill to ACTION...
```

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| Red team analysis (stress-test existing content) | `Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md` |
| Adversarial validation (produce new content via competition) | `Workflows/AdversarialValidation.md` |

---

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **ParallelAnalysis** | Stress-test existing content | Steelman + Counter-argument (8-points each) |
| **AdversarialValidation** | Produce new content via competition | Synthesized solution from competing proposals |

**The Five-Phase Protocol (ParallelAnalysis):**
1. **Decomposition** - Break into 24 atomic claims
2. **Parallel Analysis** - 32 agents examine strengths AND weaknesses
3. **Synthesis** - Identify convergent insights
4. **Steelman** - Strongest version of the argument
5. **Counter-Argument** - Strongest rebuttal

## Examples

**Attack an architecture proposal:**
```
User: "red team this microservices migration plan"
--> Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Returns steelman + devastating counter-argument (8 points each)
```

**Devil's advocate on a business decision:**
```
User: "poke holes in my plan to raise prices 20%"
--> Workflows/ParallelAnalysis.md
--> Surfaces the ONE core issue that could collapse the plan
```

**Adversarial validation for content:**
```
User: "battle of bots - which approach is better for this feature?"
--> Workflows/AdversarialValidation.md
--> Synthesizes best solution from competing ideas
```

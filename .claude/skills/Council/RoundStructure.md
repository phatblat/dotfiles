# Round Structure

How council debates progress through rounds.

## Three-Round Debate Structure

### Round 1 - Initial Positions

Each agent gives their take from their specialized perspective. No interaction yet - just establishing positions.

**Goal:** Surface diverse viewpoints before interaction.

### Round 2 - Responses & Challenges

Each agent reads Round 1 transcript and responds to specific points:
- "I disagree with Architect's point about X because..."
- "Building on Designer's concern about Y..."

**Goal:** Genuine intellectual friction through direct engagement.

### Round 3 - Synthesis & Convergence

Each agent identifies:
- Where the council agrees
- Where they still disagree
- Their final recommendation given the full discussion

**Goal:** Surface convergence and remaining tensions honestly.

## The Value Is In Interaction

Not just collecting opinions - genuine challenges where:
- Architect challenges designer's assumption
- Engineer points out implementation cost
- Researcher cites precedent that changes framing
- Designer defends with user impact data

## Timing

| Phase | Duration | Parallelism |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Round 1 | 10-20 sec | All agents parallel |
| Round 2 | 10-20 sec | All agents parallel |
| Round 3 | 10-20 sec | All agents parallel |
| Synthesis | 5 sec | Sequential |

**Total: 30-90 seconds for full debate**

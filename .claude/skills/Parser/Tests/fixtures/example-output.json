    "summary": {
      "short": "OpenAI releases GPT-4, a multimodal AI model with significantly improved reasoning capabilities, scoring 90th percentile on the bar exam.",
      "medium": "OpenAI has released GPT-4, its most advanced AI model yet, featuring multimodal capabilities (text and image input) and substantial reasoning improvements. The model achieves 90th percentile performance on the bar exam, up from GPT-3.5's 10th percentile, and shows enhanced performance across numerous benchmarks. GPT-4 also demonstrates reduced hallucinations and better adherence to safety guidelines. The model is being rolled out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, with API access coming to developers.",
      "long": "OpenAI has unveiled GPT-4, marking a significant advancement in large language model capabilities. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is multimodal, accepting both text and image inputs while generating text outputs. This architectural enhancement enables new use cases including visual analysis, chart interpretation, and document understanding.\n\nThe model demonstrates substantial improvements in reasoning and problem-solving. On standardized tests, GPT-4 achieves 90th percentile on the bar exam (vs GPT-3.5's 10th percentile), 99th percentile on GRE Verbal, and high scores across numerous academic benchmarks. OpenAI attributes these gains to improved training methodologies and architectural refinements.\n\nSafety and alignment received major focus in GPT-4's development. The model shows 82% reduction in responding to disallowed content requests and 40% improvement in producing factual responses compared to GPT-3.5. OpenAI employed constitutional AI techniques and extensive red-teaming before public release.\n\nAvailability begins immediately for ChatGPT Plus subscribers and gradually expands to API customers through a waitlist system."

# How to test iOS apps with GStack iOS

This is the end-to-end walkthrough for the iOS QA capability that ships with gstack: install the canonical Swift templates into your app, connect a real iPhone over USB, and drive it from any agent (Claude Code locally, or any HTTP-capable agent over Tailscale). No simulators, no XCTest harness, no WebDriverAgent.

Everything below has been verified end-to-end on a real iPhone 17 Pro Max running iOS 26.5. The same flow works on any iOS 16+ device.

## What you'll need

- macOS with Xcode 16.0+ installed (`xcrun devicectl --version` must succeed). Xcode 16 ships the CoreDevice tunnel `devicectl` uses to reach the device over USB.
- A real iPhone running iOS 16 or later. Unlocked, paired with your Mac, with **Developer Mode** enabled in Settings → Privacy & Security.
- An Apple developer team — the free personal team works fine for live-device debug deploys. You'll need the team ID (e.g. `623FYQ2M88`), not the certificate ID. Find it in Xcode → Settings → Accounts → your Apple ID → team list. The setup signs the app for your device on first deploy via `-allowProvisioningUpdates -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration`.
- gstack installed (`./setup` complete; `bin/gstack-ios-qa-daemon` must be on disk and executable).
- Bun runtime on PATH (`bun --version`). The Mac-side daemon is a bun process.

For the optional remote-agent (Tailscale) mode, you'll additionally need Tailscale installed on the Mac with `/var/run/tailscale.sock` readable.

```

- iOS app embeds a `StateServer` (`DebugBridge` SPM library, `#if DEBUG` only) listening on `::1` + `127.0.0.1` port 9999. Bearer-token gated. Boot token rotates within ~5 seconds of daemon spawn so anything scraping `os_log` past then sees a dead credential.
- Mac daemon brokers traffic over the CoreDevice IPv6 tunnel that `xcrun devicectl` opens automatically when a paired device is connected.
- In Tailscale mode, the daemon exposes a separate listener bound to your tailnet IP, with capability tiers (observe / interact / mutate / restore) enforced per session token. Tokens are minted explicitly by the Mac owner via `gstack-ios-qa-mint`; remote callers never auto-allowlist.

The iOS `StateServer` is loopback-only **always**, even in remote mode. Identity validation happens Mac-side because the iPhone has no way to validate a Tailscale identity.

## Step 1: Add the DebugBridge templates to your iOS app

The templates live at `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ios-qa/templates/` after `./setup`. The fastest install is to invoke the `/ios-qa` skill in Claude Code from your app's root — it reads your Swift source, codegens typed `@Observable` state accessors, and lays down the templates with your bundle ID. Or do it by hand:

1. Copy these into a `DebugBridge/` SPM package inside your app workspace:
   - `Sources/DebugBridgeCore/StateServer.swift` (from `StateServer.swift.template`)
   - `Sources/DebugBridgeCore/DebugBridgeManager.swift` (from `DebugBridgeManager.swift.template`)
   - `Sources/DebugBridgeTouch/DebugBridgeTouch.m` + `Sources/DebugBridgeTouch/include/DebugBridgeTouch.h` (from the two `.template` files)
   - `Sources/DebugBridgeUI/Bridges.swift` (from `Bridges.swift.template`)
   - `Sources/DebugBridgeUI/DebugOverlay.swift` (from `DebugOverlay.swift.template`)
   - `Package.swift` (from `Package.swift.template`)
2. Add the package as a local dependency of your app. Depend on the `DebugBridgeUI` product with `condition: .when(configuration: .debug)`. `DebugBridgeCore` and `DebugBridgeTouch` come in transitively.
3. In your `@main` App init, gate the wiring on `#if DEBUG`:

   ```swift
   #if DEBUG
   import DebugBridgeCore
   StateServer.shared.start()
   #if canImport(UIKit)
   import DebugBridgeUI
   DebugBridgeUIWiring.installAll()
   #endif
   #endif
   ```

The three Swift targets split as: `DebugBridgeCore` is cross-platform (so `swift build` on a CI Mac host can validate the bulk of the code without UIKit), `DebugBridgeUI` and `DebugBridgeTouch` are iOS-only (they link UIKit). `DebugBridgeTouch` is Objective-C — it carries the KIF-derived UITouch synthesis with the iOS 18+ `_UIHitTestContext` fix that makes SwiftUI Button taps actually fire.

The structural Release-build guard is the `.when(configuration: .debug)` clause in `Package.swift`. SwiftPM refuses to link any `DebugBridge*` target in a Release build, so the bridge cannot ship to TestFlight even if you forget to clean up.

## Step 2: Build + install to the device

From the app's project directory:

```
xcodebuild \
  -scheme YourAppScheme \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/build \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID \
  build
```

Then install + launch:

```
UDID=$(xcrun devicectl list devices 2>/dev/null | awk 'NR>2 && $0!="" {print $(NF-2); exit}')
xcrun devicectl device install app --device "$UDID" /tmp/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/YourApp.app
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device "$UDID" --terminate-existing your.bundle.id
```

If the phone is locked you'll get `FBSOpenApplicationServiceErrorDomain error 1 — Locked`. Unlock and retry. First-time installs surface a Trust dialog on the phone; tap Trust, then re-run.

## Step 3: Start the Mac-side daemon

Two options.

**Option A — let the skill spawn it.** Run `/ios-qa` in Claude Code from anywhere; the skill spawns the daemon on demand, bootstraps the tunnel, rotates the boot token, and exposes the device through the proxy. Cleanest path for local-USB use.

**Option B — start it yourself.** Run:

```
gstack-ios-qa-daemon
```

The daemon prints `READY: port=<n> pid=<pid>` once both loopback listeners are bound. The default port is 9099. Spawners can read that line with a ~5 second timeout to confirm readiness; you can also point `curl` at the printed port.

Either way the daemon takes an exclusive flock on `~/.gstack/ios-qa-daemon.pid` — running it twice from two Claude Code sessions is safe; the second invocation discovers the running daemon's port and joins.

Set these env vars to target a specific device or bundle:

```
GSTACK_IOS_TARGET_UDID=248C3A58-B843-5BDB-8F5D-89ADB7D7BF6A
GSTACK_IOS_TARGET_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourorg.yourapp
GSTACK_IOS_DAEMON_PORT=9099       # loopback listener port; default 9099
```

If `GSTACK_IOS_TARGET_UDID` is unset, the daemon picks the first paired connected device.

## Step 4: Drive the device

Once the daemon is running, you have an HTTP surface at `http://127.0.0.1:9099` (or `[::1]:9099`). The skill flow does this for you, but the raw endpoints are:

| Endpoint | What it does | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | Version probe. | none (loopback) |
| `POST /auth/rotate` | Daemon-only; rotates the boot token to an in-memory-only value. | boot token |
| `POST /session/acquire` | Acquire the per-device session lock. Returns `{session_id, ttl_seconds}`. | bearer |
| `POST /session/release` | Release the lock. | bearer + session |
| `GET /screenshot` | Capture a PNG of the active window. Returns `{png_base64: "..."}`. | bearer |
| `GET /elements` | Accessibility-tree snapshot. | bearer |
| `GET /state/snapshot` | Dump every `@Snapshotable` field as JSON. | bearer |
| `POST /state/restore` | Atomically restore a full snapshot. | bearer + session, mutate tier |
| `POST /tap` `{x,y}` | Synthesize a real UITouch at window coordinates. SwiftUI Buttons fire. | bearer + session, interact tier |
| `POST /swipe` `{from_x,from_y,to_x,to_y}` | Scroll the nearest enclosing UIScrollView. | bearer + session, interact tier |
| `POST /type` `{text}` | Set text on the current first responder. | bearer + session, interact tier |

Mutating requests require both an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header AND an `X-Session-Id` header. Read endpoints (`/screenshot`, `/elements`, `GET /state/*`) only need the bearer.

The state snapshot is opt-in per field via a `@Snapshotable` property wrapper on your canonical state struct. Fields you don't annotate never appear in the snapshot, which keeps tokens, PII, and auth state out of recorded fixtures by default.

## Step 5: Make remote agents work (optional)

To let an agent on another machine drive the device, run the daemon with `--tailnet`:

```
gstack-ios-qa-daemon --tailnet
```

The daemon probes `/var/run/tailscale.sock` first; if the socket is missing or unreadable, it refuses to open the tailnet listener at all (loopback still runs). Remote mode never half-starts.

Then mint a session token for the identity that should be able to connect:

```
gstack-ios-qa-mint grant --remote 'alice@example.com' --capability interact
gstack-ios-qa-mint grant --remote 'tag:ci' --capability mutate --ttl 86400 --note 'nightly'
gstack-ios-qa-mint list
```

Capability tiers are nested: `observe` (read endpoints only) ⊂ `interact` (taps, swipes, type) ⊂ `mutate` (`POST /state/*`) ⊂ `restore` (`POST /state/restore`). Pick the smallest tier that does the job. The allowlist file is at `~/.gstack/ios-qa-allowlist.json` (mode 0600) — the daemon reads it on every `/auth/mint` request, so changes take effect immediately without restarting.

The remote agent then hits `POST /auth/mint` against the daemon's tailnet listener. The daemon canonicalizes the caller's identity via tailscaled's WhoIs endpoint, checks the allowlist, and returns a short-lived session token (1 hour default, 24 hour cap). Every authenticated mutating request lands in `~/.gstack/security/ios-qa-audit.jsonl`; rejected requests land in `~/.gstack/security/attempts.jsonl`.

## Step 6: Ship a release build

Before you ship to TestFlight or the App Store, run `/ios-clean`. It removes the `DebugBridge` SPM dependency and strips the `#if DEBUG` wiring from your `@main` App. The structural guard in `Package.swift` (`condition: .when(configuration: .debug)`) means a Release build wouldn't link the bridge even if you forgot to clean up, but `/ios-clean` gives you a tidy diff to review and ship.

## Common failures

| Symptom | What broke |
|---|---|
| `xcodebuild` fails with `Could not locate device support files for iOS X.Y` | Run `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` to fetch the device support package for your iPhone's iOS version (~8GB). |
| Install succeeds, `process launch` fails with `Locked` | The phone is locked. Unlock and retry. |
| First install on a paired device fails with no clear error | The phone needs to Trust the Mac. Open Settings → General → VPN & Device Management on the phone and confirm. |
| `Developer Mode` toggle missing from Settings → Privacy | Connect the device to Xcode → Window → Devices and Simulators once, or try any `devicectl device install` against it. iOS will surface the toggle after the first attempt. |
| `xcrun devicectl device copy from` returns ERROR 7000 | The source path is wrong — boot token lives at `tmp/gstack-ios-qa.token` inside the app's data container (NSTemporaryDirectory), not at the path's root. |
| `/healthz` returns 200 but `/tap` returns ok:true with no UI change | The phone is paired but the StateServer port may have changed across launches. Re-resolve the CoreDevice IPv6 (`dscacheutil -q host -a name '<DeviceName>.coredevice.local'`). |
| `403 identity_not_allowed` from `/auth/mint` | The remote caller's identity isn't on the Mac's allowlist. Run `gstack-ios-qa-mint grant --remote <identity> --capability interact` on the Mac. |
| Daemon won't open the tailnet listener | Tailscale isn't installed, or `/var/run/tailscale.sock` is unreadable. Fix Tailscale, then restart the daemon. Loopback still runs in the meantime. |
| SwiftUI Button tap returns `ok:true` but the action never fires | You're on iOS 17 or older where `_UIHitTestContext` doesn't exist. The DebugBridgeTouch implementation falls back to plain `hitTest:` which doesn't resolve into SwiftUI's gesture container. Update to iOS 18+ on the device, or tap a UIKit control instead. |

## What this gets you

You can write an agent loop in any language that speaks HTTP. Take a screenshot, ask a model what to do, send a tap. Capture state snapshots before and after to record deterministic fixtures for `/ios-fix` regression tests. Add a colleague to the allowlist and they drive your iPhone from their laptop over Tailscale without ever touching the hardware. Plug the same daemon into CI by minting a `tag:ci` session token with mutate-tier capability and a 24-hour TTL.

The whole stack is a Mac you already own, an iPhone you already own, a free Apple developer account, and gstack. No paid testing service. No simulator drift. The thing the user sees is what the agent drives.

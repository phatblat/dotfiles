\`REPO_MODE\` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **\`solo\`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **\`collaborative\`** / **\`unknown\`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.`;

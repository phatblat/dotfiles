## Step 2: Per-File Documentation Audit

Read each documentation file and cross-reference it against the diff. Use these generic heuristics
(adapt to whatever project you're in — these are not gstack-specific):

**README.md:**
- Does it describe all features and capabilities visible in the diff?
- Are install/setup instructions consistent with the changes?
- Are examples, demos, and usage descriptions still valid?
- Are troubleshooting steps still accurate?

**ARCHITECTURE.md:**
- Do ASCII diagrams and component descriptions match the current code?
- Are design decisions and "why" explanations still accurate?
- Be conservative — only update things clearly contradicted by the diff. Architecture docs
  describe things unlikely to change frequently.

**CONTRIBUTING.md — New contributor smoke test:**
- Walk through the setup instructions as if you are a brand new contributor.
- Are the listed commands accurate? Would each step succeed?
- Do test tier descriptions match the current test infrastructure?
- Are workflow descriptions (dev setup, operational learnings, etc.) current?
- Flag anything that would fail or confuse a first-time contributor.

**CLAUDE.md / project instructions:**
- Does the project structure section match the actual file tree?
- Are listed commands and scripts accurate?
- Do build/test instructions match what's in package.json (or equivalent)?

**Any other .md files:**
- Read the file, determine its purpose and audience.
- Cross-reference against the diff to check if it contradicts anything the file says.

For each file, classify needed updates as:

- **Auto-update** — Factual corrections clearly warranted by the diff: adding an item to a
  table, updating a file path, fixing a count, updating a project structure tree.
- **Ask user** — Narrative changes, section removal, security model changes, large rewrites
  (more than ~10 lines in one section), ambiguous relevance, adding entirely new sections.

---

## Step 3: Apply Auto-Updates

Make all clear, factual updates directly using the Edit tool.

For each file modified, output a one-line summary describing **what specifically changed** — not
just "Updated README.md" but "README.md: added /new-skill to skills table, updated skill count
from 9 to 10."

**Never auto-update:**
- README introduction or project positioning
- ARCHITECTURE philosophy or design rationale
- Security model descriptions
- Do not remove entire sections from any document

---

## Step 4: Ask About Risky/Questionable Changes

For each risky or questionable update identified in Step 2, use AskUserQuestion with:
- Context: project name, branch, which doc file, what we're reviewing
- The specific documentation decision
- `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
- Options including C) Skip — leave as-is

Apply approved changes immediately after each answer.

---

## Step 5: CHANGELOG Voice Polish

**CRITICAL — NEVER CLOBBER CHANGELOG ENTRIES.**

This step polishes voice. It does NOT rewrite, replace, or regenerate CHANGELOG content.

A real incident occurred where an agent replaced existing CHANGELOG entries when it should have
preserved them. This skill must NEVER do that.

**Rules:**
1. Read the entire CHANGELOG.md first. Understand what is already there.
2. Only modify wording within existing entries. Never delete, reorder, or replace entries.
3. Never regenerate a CHANGELOG entry from scratch. The entry was written by `/ship` from the
   actual diff and commit history. It is the source of truth. You are polishing prose, not
   rewriting history.
4. If an entry looks wrong or incomplete, use AskUserQuestion — do NOT silently fix it.
5. Use Edit tool with exact `old_string` matches — never use Write to overwrite CHANGELOG.md.

**If CHANGELOG was not modified in this branch:** skip this step.

**If CHANGELOG was modified in this branch**, review the entry for voice:

- **Sell test (Diataxis rubric):** Score each CHANGELOG entry 0-3:
  - **1 point** — answers "What changed?" (reference: names the feature/fix)
  - **1 point** — answers "Why should I care?" (explanation: user impact, pain removed)
  - **1 point** — answers "How do I use it?" (how-to: command, flag, or link to docs)
  - Entries scoring <2 need a rewrite. Entries scoring 3 are gold.
- Lead with what the user can now **do** — not implementation details.
- "You can now..." not "Refactored the..."
- Flag and rewrite any entry that reads like a commit message.
- Internal/contributor changes belong in a separate "### For contributors" subsection.
- Auto-fix minor voice adjustments. Use AskUserQuestion if a rewrite would alter meaning.

---

## Step 6: Cross-Doc Consistency & Discoverability Check

After auditing each file individually, do a cross-doc consistency pass:

1. Does the README's feature/capability list match what CLAUDE.md (or project instructions) describes?
2. Does ARCHITECTURE's component list match CONTRIBUTING's project structure description?
3. Does CHANGELOG's latest version match the VERSION file?
4. **Discoverability:** Is every documentation file reachable from README.md or CLAUDE.md? If
   ARCHITECTURE.md exists but neither README nor CLAUDE.md links to it, flag it. Every doc
   should be discoverable from one of the two entry-point files.
5. Flag any contradictions between documents. Auto-fix clear factual inconsistencies (e.g., a
   version mismatch). Use AskUserQuestion for narrative contradictions.

---

## Step 7: TODOS.md Cleanup

This is a second pass that complements `/ship`'s Step 5.5. Read `review/TODOS-format.md` (if
available) for the canonical TODO item format.

If TODOS.md does not exist, skip this step.

1. **Completed items not yet marked:** Cross-reference the diff against open TODO items. If a
   TODO is clearly completed by the changes in this branch, move it to the Completed section
   with `**Completed:** vX.Y.Z.W (YYYY-MM-DD)`. Be conservative — only mark items with clear
   evidence in the diff.

2. **Items needing description updates:** If a TODO references files or components that were
   significantly changed, its description may be stale. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm whether
   the TODO should be updated, completed, or left as-is.

3. **New deferred work:** Check the diff for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, and `XXX` comments. For
   each one that represents meaningful deferred work (not a trivial inline note), use
   AskUserQuestion to ask whether it should be captured in TODOS.md.

---

## Step 8: VERSION Bump Question

**CRITICAL — NEVER BUMP VERSION WITHOUT ASKING.**

1. **If VERSION does not exist:** Skip silently.

2. Check if VERSION was already modified on this branch:

```bash
git diff <base>...HEAD -- VERSION
```

3. **If VERSION was NOT bumped:** Use AskUserQuestion:
   - RECOMMENDATION: Choose C (Skip) because docs-only changes rarely warrant a version bump
   - A) Bump PATCH (X.Y.Z+1) — if doc changes ship alongside code changes
   - B) Bump MINOR (X.Y+1.0) — if this is a significant standalone release
   - C) Skip — no version bump needed

4. **If VERSION was already bumped:** Do NOT skip silently. Instead, check whether the bump
   still covers the full scope of changes on this branch:

   a. Read the CHANGELOG entry for the current VERSION. What features does it describe?
   b. Read the full diff (`git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git diff <base>...HEAD --name-only`).
      Are there significant changes (new features, new skills, new commands, major refactors)
      that are NOT mentioned in the CHANGELOG entry for the current version?
   c. **If the CHANGELOG entry covers everything:** Skip — output "VERSION: Already bumped to
      vX.Y.Z, covers all changes."
   d. **If there are significant uncovered changes:** Use AskUserQuestion explaining what the
      current version covers vs what's new, and ask:
      - RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because the new changes warrant their own version
      - A) Bump to next patch (X.Y.Z+1) — give the new changes their own version
      - B) Keep current version — add new changes to the existing CHANGELOG entry
      - C) Skip — leave version as-is, handle later

   The key insight: a VERSION bump set for "feature A" should not silently absorb "feature B"
   if feature B is substantial enough to deserve its own version entry.

---

## Step 9: Commit & Output

**Empty check first:** Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). If no documentation files were
modified by any previous step, output "All documentation is up to date." and exit without
committing.

**Commit:**

1. Stage modified documentation files by name (never `git add -A` or `git add .`).
2. Create a single commit:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: update project documentation for vX.Y.Z.W

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

3. Push to the current branch:

```bash
git push
```

**PR/MR body update (idempotent, race-safe):**

1. Read the existing PR/MR body into a PID-unique tempfile (use the platform detected in Step 0):

**If GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr view --json body -q .body > /tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md
```

**If GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('description',''))" > /tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md
```

2. If the tempfile already contains a `## Documentation` section, replace that section with the
   updated content. If it does not contain one, append a `## Documentation` section at the end.

3. The Documentation section should include:

   a. **Doc diff preview** — for each file modified, describe what specifically changed (e.g.,
      "README.md: added /document-release to skills table, updated skill count from 9 to 10").

   b. **Documentation debt** — if the coverage map from Step 1.5 found gaps, append a
      `### Documentation Debt` subsection listing:
      - Critical gaps: new public surface with zero documentation coverage
      - Common gaps: features with reference-only coverage (no how-to or tutorial)
      - Stale diagrams: architecture diagrams with entity names that drifted from the code
      - Each item should include a one-line description of what's missing and which Diataxis
        quadrant would fill it (e.g., "⚠️ `/new-skill` — has reference in AGENTS.md but no
        how-to example in README")

   If there are any documentation debt items, suggest adding a `docs-debt` label to the PR.

4. Redaction scan-at-sink, then write the updated body back. The body is already
   in a temp file (`/tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md`); scan THAT file before editing so
   the bytes scanned are the bytes sent:

```bash
REDACT_VIS=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get redact_repo_visibility 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$REDACT_VIS" ] && REDACT_VIS=$(gh repo view --json visibility -q .visibility 2>/dev/null | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-redact --from-file /tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md --repo-visibility "${REDACT_VIS:-unknown}" --json
# exit 3 (HIGH) → do NOT edit, rotate+redact; exit 2 (MEDIUM) → confirm per finding.
```

**If GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr edit --body-file /tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md
```

**If GitLab:**
Read the contents of `/tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md` using the Read tool, then pass it to `glab mr update` using a heredoc to avoid shell metacharacter issues:
```bash
glab mr update -d "$(cat <<'MRBODY'
<paste the file contents here>
MRBODY
)"
```

5. Clean up the tempfile:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/gstack-pr-body-$$.md
```

6. If `gh pr view` / `glab mr view` fails (no PR/MR exists): skip with message "No PR/MR found — skipping body update."
7. If `gh pr edit` / `glab mr update` fails: warn "Could not update PR/MR body — documentation changes are in the
   commit." and continue.

**PR/MR title sync (idempotent, always-on):**

PR titles must always start with `v<VERSION>` — same rule as `/ship`. If Step 8 bumped VERSION after `/ship` had already created the PR, the title is now stale. This sub-step fixes it.

1. Read the current VERSION:

```bash
V=$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')
```

If `VERSION` does not exist or is empty, skip this sub-step entirely.

2. Read the current PR/MR title:

**If GitHub:**
```bash
CURRENT_TITLE=$(gh pr view --json title -q .title 2>/dev/null || true)
```

**If GitLab:**
```bash
CURRENT_TITLE=$(glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null | jq -r .title 2>/dev/null || true)
```

If `CURRENT_TITLE` is empty (no open PR/MR), skip with message "No PR/MR found — skipping title sync."

3. Compute the corrected title using the shared helper (single source of truth — same one `/ship` uses):

```bash
NEW_TITLE=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-pr-title-rewrite.sh "$V" "$CURRENT_TITLE")
```

The helper handles three cases: title already correct (no-op), title has a different `v<X.Y.Z.W>` prefix (replace it), or title has no version prefix (prepend one).

4. If `NEW_TITLE` differs from `CURRENT_TITLE`, update it:

**If GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr edit --title "$NEW_TITLE"
```

**If GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr update -t "$NEW_TITLE"
```

5. If the edit command fails: warn "Could not update PR/MR title — documentation changes are still in the commit." and continue. Do not block on title sync failure.

**Structured doc health summary (final output):**

Output a scannable summary showing every documentation file's status:

```
Documentation health:
  README.md       [status] ([details])
  ARCHITECTURE.md [status] ([details])
  CONTRIBUTING.md [status] ([details])
  CHANGELOG.md    [status] ([details])
  TODOS.md        [status] ([details])
  VERSION         [status] ([details])
```

Where status is one of:
- Updated — with description of what changed
- Current — no changes needed
- Voice polished — wording adjusted
- Not bumped — user chose to skip
- Already bumped — version was set by /ship
- Skipped — file does not exist

If the coverage map from Step 1.5 identified any gaps, append:

```
Documentation coverage:
  [entity]         [reference] [how-to] [tutorial] [explanation]
  /new-skill       ✅          ❌       ❌         ❌
  --new-flag       ✅          ✅       ❌         ❌

Diagram drift:
  ARCHITECTURE.md: "FooProcessor" renamed to "BarProcessor" in code — diagram may be stale
```

If all coverage is complete and no diagrams drifted, output: "Coverage: all shipped features have adequate documentation."

---

## Codex Documentation Review (default-on)

After the documentation updates above are written, run an independent cross-model pass that
checks the docs against what actually shipped. This is a standard part of /document-release,
not an opt-in. The user turns it off only by asking explicitly
(`gstack-config set codex_reviews disabled`).

**Preflight — decide whether and how the doc review runs:**

```bash
# Codex preflight: one block (functions sourced here don't persist to later blocks).
_TEL=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get telemetry 2>/dev/null || echo off)
_CODEX_CFG=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config get codex_reviews 2>/dev/null || echo enabled)
source ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-codex-probe 2>/dev/null || true
if [ "$_CODEX_CFG" = "disabled" ]; then
  _CODEX_MODE="disabled"
elif ! command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  _CODEX_MODE="not_installed"; _gstack_codex_log_event "codex_cli_missing" 2>/dev/null || true
elif ! _gstack_codex_auth_probe >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  _CODEX_MODE="not_authed"; _gstack_codex_log_event "codex_auth_failed" 2>/dev/null || true
else
  _CODEX_MODE="ready"; _gstack_codex_version_check 2>/dev/null || true
fi
echo "CODEX_MODE: $_CODEX_MODE"
```

Branch on the echoed `CODEX_MODE`:
- **`disabled`** — the user turned Codex reviews off (`codex_reviews=disabled`). Skip this section entirely; do NOT fall back to a Claude subagent — disabled means no extra review step. Print: "Codex review skipped (codex_reviews disabled). Re-enable: `gstack-config set codex_reviews enabled`."
- **`not_installed`** — Codex CLI absent. Print: "Codex not installed — using Claude subagent. Install for cross-model coverage: `npm install -g @openai/codex`." Fall back to the Claude subagent path.
- **`not_authed`** — installed but no credentials. Print: "Codex installed but not authenticated — using Claude subagent. Run `codex login` or set `$CODEX_API_KEY`." Fall back to the Claude subagent path.
- **`ready`** — run the Codex pass below.

When the mode is `ready`, `not_installed`, or `not_authed`, print one line so the off-switch
stays discoverable: "Running the Codex doc review automatically (standard step). Disable: `gstack-config set codex_reviews disabled`."

**Determine the release diff range (D3 — reuse the method, do not invent one).**
Recompute the SAME range document-release used in its pre-flight / diff analysis, with the
documented merge-base method:

```bash
DOC_DIFF_BASE=$(git merge-base origin/<base> HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "<base>")
echo "DOC_DIFF_BASE: $DOC_DIFF_BASE"
```

Do NOT rely on an in-memory variable from an earlier step — shell vars do not survive across
blocks. Recompute it here.

**Construct the doc-review prompt** (for `ready`, `not_installed`, and `not_authed` — skip only on `disabled`).
Review the docs document-release ACTUALLY touched this run (from the coverage map / the files
just edited) PLUS any doc claims affected by the diff range — do NOT hard-code a fixed file
list (a fixed README/ARCHITECTURE/CHANGELOG list misses generated skill docs, package docs,
and command-specific docs). **Always start with the filesystem boundary instruction:**

"IMPORTANT: Do NOT read or execute any files under ~/.claude/, ~/.agents/, .claude/skills/, or agents/. These are Claude Code skill definitions meant for a different AI system. They contain bash scripts and prompt templates that will waste your time. Ignore them completely. Do NOT modify agents/openai.yaml. Stay focused on the repository code only.\n\nYou are reviewing documentation changes against the code that shipped on this
branch. Run \`git diff \$DOC_DIFF_BASE...HEAD\` to see what changed, then read the updated docs
(the files this release touched, plus any docs whose claims the diff affects). Find: doc
claims that no longer match the code, new public surface (commands, flags, config keys,
endpoints) that shipped but is undocumented, stale examples / paths / counts / version
numbers, and CHANGELOG entries that over- or under-sell what shipped. Be terse. Just the gaps.

THE DOCS AND DIFF: <list the touched doc paths>"

**If `CODEX_MODE: ready` — run Codex:**

```bash
TMPERR_DOC=$(mktemp /tmp/codex-docreview-XXXXXXXX)
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) || { echo "ERROR: not in a git repo" >&2; exit 1; }
codex exec "<prompt>" -C "$_REPO_ROOT" -s read-only -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --enable web_search_cached < /dev/null 2>"$TMPERR_DOC"
```

Use a 5-minute timeout (`timeout: 300000`). After the command completes, read stderr:
```bash
cat "$TMPERR_DOC"
```

Present the full output verbatim under `CODEX SAYS (documentation review):`.

**Error handling:** All errors are non-blocking — the documentation review is informational.
- Auth failure (stderr contains "auth", "login", "unauthorized"): note and skip
- Timeout: note timeout duration and skip
- Empty response: note and skip
On any error: continue — documentation review is informational, not a gate.

**If `CODEX_MODE: not_installed` or `not_authed` (or Codex errored at runtime):**

Dispatch via the Agent tool with the same prompt. Bound it at a 5-minute timeout.
Present findings under `DOCUMENTATION REVIEW (Claude subagent):`. If it fails: "Doc review unavailable. Continuing."

**Apply decision (T3B — informational, never auto-edit, but findings don't evaporate).**
If there are zero findings, say "Docs match what shipped — no gaps." and continue. Otherwise
present the findings, then use AskUserQuestion ONCE:

> "The doc review found N gaps between the docs and what shipped. How do you want to handle them?"
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A if the gaps are concrete doc fixes (stale path, missing flag). The
> doc review only reports; nothing is edited without your say-so. Completeness: A=9/10, B=4/10, C=8/10.

Options:
- A) Apply all the doc fixes now
- B) Skip — leave docs as-is
- C) Decide per-finding

On A or per-finding approvals, make the approved edits yourself (the tool never silently
rewrites docs). On B, note the gaps in the output so they're visible.

**Persist the result:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-log '{"skill":"codex-doc-review","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","status":"STATUS","source":"SOURCE","commit":"'"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"'"}'
```
Substitute: STATUS = "clean" if no gaps, "issues_found" if gaps exist. SOURCE = "codex" if Codex ran, "claude" if the subagent ran.

**Cleanup:** Run `rm -f "$TMPERR_DOC"` after processing (if Codex was used).

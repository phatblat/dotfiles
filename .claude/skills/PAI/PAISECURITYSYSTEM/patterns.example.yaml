# 1. Copy this file to USER/PAISECURITYSYSTEM/patterns.yaml
# 2. Customize patterns for your environment

# Philosophy: Safe but functional by default
# Block catastrophic operations, confirm dangerous ones, allow everything else
philosophy:
  mode: safe_functional
  principle: "Meaningful protection without friction that drives people to disable security"

# ========================================
# BASH COMMAND PATTERNS
# ========================================
bash:
  # BLOCKED - Catastrophic/irreversible (exit 2)
  # These operations are NEVER allowed - they cause irreversible damage
  blocked:
    # Filesystem destruction
    - pattern: "rm -rf /"
      reason: "Filesystem destruction"
    - pattern: "rm -rf ~"
      reason: "Home directory destruction"
    - pattern: "sudo rm -rf /"
      reason: "Filesystem destruction with sudo"
    - pattern: "sudo rm -rf ~"

    # Disk operations
    - pattern: "diskutil eraseDisk"
      reason: "Disk destruction"
    - pattern: "diskutil zeroDisk"

    # Repository operations
    - pattern: "gh repo delete"

  # CONFIRM - Dangerous but sometimes legitimate (exit 0 + JSON prompt)
  # User will be prompted to confirm before execution
  confirm:
    # Git operations
    - pattern: "git push --force"
      reason: "Force push can lose commits"
    - pattern: "git push -f"

      reason: "Volume data deletion"
    - pattern: "kubectl delete namespace"
      reason: "Namespace deletion"

    # Databases
    - pattern: "DELETE FROM.*WHERE"
      reason: "Database deletion (confirm scope)"
    - pattern: "DROP DATABASE"
      reason: "Database destruction"
    - pattern: "DROP TABLE"
      reason: "Table destruction"
    - pattern: "TRUNCATE"

  # ALERT - Suspicious but allowed (log only, no block)
  # These are logged for security review but not blocked
  alert:
    - pattern: "curl.*\\|.*sh"
      reason: "Piping curl to shell"
    - pattern: "curl.*\\|.*bash"

# ========================================
# PATH PROTECTION
# ========================================
paths:
  # ZERO ACCESS - Complete denial for all operations (read/write/delete)
  # These paths contain secrets that should never be accessed
  zeroAccess:
    - "~/.ssh/id_*"
    - "~/.ssh/*.pem"
    - "~/.aws/credentials"
    - "~/.gnupg/private*"
    - "**/credentials.json"
    - "**/service-account*.json"

  # READ ONLY - Can read but cannot modify or delete
  readOnly:
    - "/etc/**"

  # CONFIRM WRITE - Can read freely, writing requires confirmation
  confirmWrite:
    - "**/.env"
    - "**/.env.*"
    - "~/.ssh/*"

  # NO DELETE - Can read and modify but cannot delete
  # Add paths to important configuration or infrastructure files
  noDelete:
    - ".git/**"
    - "LICENSE*"
    - "README.md"

# ========================================
# SPECIAL PROJECT RULES
# ========================================
# Add project-specific rules here
# Example:
# projects:
#   my-project:
#     path: "~/Projects/my-project"
#     rules:
#       - action: "block_git_push"
#         reason: "Deploy via custom method only"

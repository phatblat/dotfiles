# USER/ Directory — Personal Customizations

This directory contains YOUR personal configuration that extends the SYSTEM/ defaults.

**Architecture:** SYSTEM/ provides universal rules. USER/ extends and overrides them for your personal preferences.

## Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AISTEERINGRULES.md` | Your personal behavioral rules (extends SYSTEM/AISTEERINGRULES.md) |
| `TECHSTACKPREFERENCES.md` | Your preferred technology stack |
| `RESPONSEFORMAT.md` | Your output format preferences |
| `CONTACTS.md` | Your contact directory |
| `DEFINITIONS.md` | Your canonical definitions |
| `ASSETMANAGEMENT.md` | Your digital assets registry |
| `DAIDENTITY.md` | Your DA (Digital Assistant) identity configuration |
| `ABOUTME.md` | About you — context for your assistant |

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ACTIONS/` | Your personal Arbol actions (override SYSTEM actions) |
| `PIPELINES/` | Your personal Arbol pipelines |
| `FLOWS/` | Your personal Arbol flows |
| `TELOS/` | Your life goals, beliefs, challenges (Telos Life System) |
| `PROJECTS/` | Your project references and paths |
| `SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/` | Per-skill preference overrides |

## How It Works

1. Place your files in this directory
2. PAI loads SYSTEM/ first, then USER/ extends/overrides
3. Your personal data never leaves this directory
4. Public PAI releases include this USER/ directory as **templates only**

## Getting Started

Copy any template file, fill in your information, and PAI will use it automatically.

## 🔒 AUTHORIZATION & ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS

**⚠️ CRITICAL - READ BEFORE USE ⚠️**

This skill is part of a **Security Practice** run by a security professional with extensive experience in offensive security testing.

### Legal Requirements

**AUTHORIZATION IS MANDATORY:**
- ✅ **ONLY test systems you own** or have **explicit written permission** to test
- ✅ **ONLY use these techniques** as part of authorized penetration testing engagements
- ✅ **ALWAYS document authorization** before beginning any testing
- ✅ **RESPECT scope boundaries** defined in testing agreements
- ✅ **FOLLOW responsible disclosure** practices for any vulnerabilities discovered

**UNAUTHORIZED TESTING IS ILLEGAL:**
- ❌ **NEVER test systems** without explicit written permission
- ❌ **NEVER exceed** authorized scope boundaries
- ❌ **NEVER use these techniques** for malicious purposes
- ❌ **NEVER disclose vulnerabilities** publicly before vendor remediation
- ❌ **NEVER exfiltrate** real user data during testing

### Ethical Framework

This skill exists for **defensive security purposes:**
1. **Authorized penetration testing** of client systems under formal engagement
2. **Security assessment** of your own systems and products
3. **Research and education** for improving AI/LLM security practices
4. **Responsible disclosure** of vulnerabilities to vendors for remediation

**Any use of this skill constitutes acceptance of these terms and agreement to use only for authorized, ethical security testing purposes.**

## Workflow Routing

**When executing a workflow, output this notification:**
```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **PromptInjection** skill to ACTION...
```

This skill provides 5 comprehensive testing workflows:

## Quick Start

**For first assessment:**
1. Read QuickStartGuide.md (30-60 minute methodology)
2. Verify written authorization
3. Run Reconnaissance workflow
4. Test top 5 attack types
5. Document findings

**For comprehensive assessment:**
1. Use CompleteAssessment workflow
2. Follow all 9 phases
3. Generate professional report

## Key Principles

### Authorization-First
1. Written authorization is mandatory
2. Document everything (scope, boundaries, approvals)
3. Respect boundaries - in-scope only
4. Stop if uncertain - clarify before proceeding

### Methodical Testing
1. Systematic approach - follow established methodology
2. Document as you go - record all tests and results
3. Reproduce findings - ensure vulnerabilities are reliable
4. Assess impact accurately - distinguish theoretical vs practical risk

### Responsible Disclosure
1. Give vendors time - 90-day disclosure timeline typical
2. Clear communication - detailed reproduction steps
3. Coordinate disclosure - work with vendor on timing
4. Protect users - no public details before patch

## Examples

**Example 1: Quick test**
```
User: "test this chatbot for prompt injection - I own it"
→ Verifies authorization
→ Runs Reconnaissance workflow
→ Tests top 5 attack types
→ Documents findings
```

**Example 2: Full assessment**
```
User: "comprehensive prompt injection assessment for client"
→ Loads CompleteAssessment workflow
→ 9-phase methodology (12-20 hours)
→ Professional report with remediation
```

**Example 3: Research**
```
User: "what are the latest jailbreaking methods?"
→ Searches COMPREHENSIVE-ATTACK-TAXONOMY.md
→ Returns categorized techniques with effectiveness ratings
```

## Support & Escalation

**When to escalate:**
- Authorization is unclear or questionable
- Ethical concerns arise
- Novel attack techniques discovered
- Critical 0-day vulnerabilities found

**Contact:**
- Configure in your USER settings

**🔒 REMINDER: AUTHORIZED USE ONLY 🔒**

This skill contains powerful security testing techniques. Use only for:
- ✅ Systems you own
- ✅ Systems with explicit written authorization
- ✅ Ethical security research
- ✅ Defensive security purposes

Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

# peon-ping-toggle

Toggle peon-ping sounds on or off. Also handles any peon-ping configuration changes.

## Toggle sounds

Run the following command using the Bash tool:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/hooks/peon-ping/peon.sh toggle
```

Report the output to the user. The command will print either:

- `peon-ping: sounds paused` — sounds are now muted
- `peon-ping: sounds resumed` — sounds are now active

## Configuration changes

For any other peon-ping setting changes (volume, pack rotation, categories, active pack, etc.), use the `peon-ping-config` skill.

**Infrastructure and Network Reconnaissance**


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Recon skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Recon** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

## Purpose

Technical reconnaissance of network infrastructure including domains, IP addresses, netblocks, and ASNs. Combines passive intelligence gathering with authorized active scanning to map attack surfaces and identify assets.


## When to Use This Skill

**Core Triggers - Use this skill when user says:**

### Direct Recon Requests
- "do recon on [target]" or "run recon"
- "perform reconnaissance on [target]" or "conduct recon"
- "do infrastructure recon" or "network reconnaissance"
- "basic recon", "quick recon", "simple recon"
- "comprehensive recon", "deep recon", "full reconnaissance"
- "recon [target]" (just recon + target)
- "passive recon", "active recon"

### Infrastructure & Network Mapping
- "map infrastructure for [domain]" or "map network"
- "enumerate [domain] infrastructure" or "discover assets"
- "find subdomains of [domain]" or "enumerate subdomains"
- "scan [target]" or "port scan [IP/netblock]"
- "what services are running on [IP]"
- "investigate [IP address/domain/netblock]"

### IP & Domain Investigation
- "recon this IP" or "investigate this IP address"
- "look up [IP]" or "IP lookup [address]"
- "what is [IP]" or "who owns [IP]"
- "domain recon" or "domain investigation"
- "DNS recon", "DNS enumeration"
- "WHOIS [domain/IP]"

### ASN & Netblock Research
- "investigate [ASN]" or "research ASN"
- "scan [CIDR range/netblock]"
- "find IPs in [netblock]"
- "enumerate netblock" or "netblock scanning"

### Passive vs Active Recon
- "passive recon on [target]" (no authorization required)
- "active scan [target]" (requires explicit authorization)
- "safe reconnaissance" (passive only)
- "authorized scan" (active techniques)

### Use Case Indicators
- Investigating IP addresses for ownership, location, and services
- Mapping domain infrastructure and DNS configuration
- Scanning netblocks or CIDR ranges for live hosts
- Researching ASN ownership and IP allocations
- Attack surface enumeration and network mapping
- Called by OSINT for infrastructure mapping of entities

## Relationship with Other Security Skills

**OSINT → recon (Common Pattern):**
- OSINT identifies entities, companies, people (social/public records focus)
- Recon maps their technical infrastructure (network/system focus)
- Example flow: OSINT finds company → Recon maps their domains/IPs/infrastructure

**recon → webassessment:**
- Recon identifies web applications and services
- Web assessment tests those applications for vulnerabilities
- Example: Recon finds subdomain api.target.com → Web assessment fuzzes/tests it

**Workflow Integration:**
```typescript
// OSINT skill discovers company infrastructure
const domains = await osintFindCompanyDomains("Acme Corp");

// Calls recon skill to map technical details
const infraMap = await reconDomain(domains[0]);

// Recon identifies web apps
const webApps = infraMap.subdomains.filter(s => s.hasHTTP);

// Calls web assessment for testing
await webAssessment(webApps);
```

## Core Capabilities

### Passive Reconnaissance (No Authorization Required)
- WHOIS lookups (domain and IP)
- DNS enumeration (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, SOA, etc.)
- Certificate transparency searches (subdomains, certificate history)
- IPInfo API (geolocation, ASN, organization, abuse contacts)
- Reverse DNS lookups
- BGP/ASN information gathering
- Historical DNS data
- Public database searches

### Active Reconnaissance (Requires Explicit Authorization)
- Port scanning (naabu MCP)
- Service detection and banner grabbing (httpx MCP)
- Technology fingerprinting
- Live host discovery
- HTTP/HTTPS probing
- SSL/TLS analysis

**CRITICAL AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**

Active reconnaissance MUST have:
1. **Explicit user confirmation** for each active scan
2. **Documented authorization** (pentest engagement, bug bounty program, owned assets)
3. **Scope validation** (ensure target is in-scope)
4. **Rate limiting** (respectful scanning, no DoS)
5. **Session logging** (record all active recon for audit trail)

**Default behavior is PASSIVE ONLY.** Always confirm before active techniques.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Authorization First** - Never perform active scanning without explicit authorization
2. **Scope Validation** - Ensure targets are in-scope for testing
3. **Rate Limiting** - Respectful scanning, no DoS or aggressive techniques
4. **Documentation** - Log all recon activities with timestamps and authorization
5. **Responsible Disclosure** - If vulnerabilities found, follow responsible disclosure
6. **No Destructive Testing** - Reconnaissance only, no exploitation

**Authorization Types:**
- Pentest engagement (written SOW/contract)
- Bug bounty program (in-scope targets only)
- Owned assets (your own infrastructure)
- Research lab/CTF environments

**Never scan:**
- Systems without permission
- Out-of-scope targets
- Critical infrastructure
- Government systems (without specific authorization)

**When in doubt:** Ask for explicit confirmation and documented authorization.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Passive Domain Recon
```
User: "Do passive recon on example.com"

Assistant: Activating recon skill with passive-recon workflow.
     Target: example.com
     Mode: Passive only (no active scanning)

     [Performs WHOIS, DNS, cert transparency, IPInfo]
     [Generates report in scratchpad]

     Report: ~/.claude/MEMORY/WORK/{current_work}/scratch/recon-example-com/
```

### Example 2: IP Investigation with Active Scan
```
User: "Investigate IP 1.2.3.4 - I own this server"

Assistant: Activating recon skill with ip-recon workflow.
     Target: 1.2.3.4

     Authorization check: You confirmed this is an owned asset.
     Proceeding with passive + active reconnaissance.

     [Performs IPInfo, reverse DNS, WHOIS, port scan, service detection]
     [Generates comprehensive report]

     Report: Open ports found (22, 80, 443)
             Services: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
             Technologies: nginx 1.20.1, OpenSSH 8.2
```

### Example 3: Integration with OSINT
```
User: "Do OSINT on Acme Corp and map their infrastructure"

Assistant: Activating OSINT skill...
     Found domains: acme.com, acmecorp.com, acme.io

     Now calling recon for infrastructure mapping...

     [Recon skill maps each domain]
     [Discovers subdomains, IPs, netblocks]
     [Creates comprehensive infrastructure map]

     Report: Complete OSINT + Infrastructure report
             15 domains, 47 subdomains, 3 netblocks identified
```

## Workflow Selection Logic

**Automatic workflow selection based on input:**
- Input matches IP pattern (x.x.x.x) → `IpRecon.md`
- Input matches domain pattern → `DomainRecon.md`
- Input matches CIDR pattern (x.x.x.x/y) → `NetblockRecon.md`
- Input matches ASN pattern (AS####) → `AsnRecon.md`
- User specifies "passive only" → `PassiveRecon.md`

**User can override:**
```
"Use passive-recon workflow on 1.2.3.4"
"Run domain-recon on example.com with active scanning"
```

## Success Criteria

**Passive Recon Success:**
- WHOIS data retrieved
- DNS records enumerated
- Certificate transparency searched
- IPInfo data gathered
- Structured report generated

**Active Recon Success:**
- Authorization confirmed and documented
- Passive recon completed first
- Port scan results (open/closed/filtered)
- Service detection performed
- Banner information gathered
- Technologies identified
- No errors or failures
- Respectful scan timing (no DoS)

**Remember:** Start passive, confirm authorization before going active, document everything, and be respectful of target systems.

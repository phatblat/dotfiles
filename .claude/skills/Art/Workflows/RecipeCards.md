## Color System for Recipe Cards

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — Step numbers, dividing lines, icon outlines
```

### Step Differentiation
```
Deep Purple #4A148C — Critical steps or outcomes
Deep Teal #00796B — Supporting steps or inputs
Charcoal #2D2D2D — All body text and descriptions
```

### Background
```
Light Cream #F5E6D3 — Recipe card warmth
OR
White #FFFFFF — Clean modern
```

### Color Strategy
- Step numbers in black (or purple for critical steps)
- Icons primarily black linework with strategic purple/teal accents
- Text in charcoal for readability
- Outcome/result step in purple (final step)

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define Process

**Identify the recipe:**

1. **What process are you documenting?**
   - Process name
   - Overall goal/outcome

2. **How many steps?**
   - Ideal: 3-7 steps (recipe card format)
   - Too many steps → break into multiple recipes

3. **What are the steps?**
   - List each action in sequence
   - What happens at each step
   - What's the outcome

**Output:**
```
PROCESS NAME: [The X Recipe / X-Step Y Method]
OUTCOME: [What this process achieves]

STEPS:
1. [Step name] — [Action description] — [Icon metaphor]
2. [Step name] — [Action description] — [Icon metaphor]
3. [Step name] — [Action description] — [Icon metaphor]
4. [Step name] — [Action description] — [Icon metaphor]
5. [Step name] — [Action description] — [Icon metaphor]

CRITICAL STEPS (Purple):
- [Which step(s) are most important]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Recipe Card Layout

**Plan the visual structure:**

1. **Layout style:**
   - Vertical list (top to bottom)
   - Grid (2x3 for 6 steps)
   - Linear horizontal flow
   - Circular flow (process loops)

2. **Step representation:**
   - Number badge (circled number)
   - Small icon illustration for step
   - Brief text description
   - Arrow to next step

3. **Visual flow:**
   - How steps connect
   - Progressive visual cues
   - Final outcome emphasis

**Output:**
```
LAYOUT: [Vertical list / Grid / Horizontal flow / Circular]

CARD STRUCTURE:
- Title at top (Tier 1 typography)
- [X] steps arranged [vertically/in grid]
- Each step contains:
  * Numbered badge (e.g., "1" in circle)
  * Small hand-drawn icon/illustration
  * Step name (Tier 2)
  * Brief description (Tier 3)
- Arrows or lines connecting steps
- Final outcome emphasized

ICON METAPHORS:
Step 1: [Simple icon, e.g., "magnifying glass" for discover]
Step 2: [Icon, e.g., "lightbulb" for ideate]
Step 3: [Icon, e.g., "hammer" for build]
...

COLOR CODING:
- Step [X] (critical): Purple badge and icon accents
- Step [Y] (outcome): Purple emphasis
- Other steps: Black badges, minimal color
```

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Recipe Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Vertical list (3-7 steps) | 9:16 or 4:3 | Tall card format |
| Grid layout (6-9 steps) | 1:1 | Square balanced grid |
| Horizontal flow | 16:9 | Wide linear progression |
| Circular process | 1:1 | Square for circular symmetry |

**Default: 9:16 (vertical)** — Classic recipe card orientation

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 9:16 \
  --output /path/to/recipe-card.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro (best text rendering for steps)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/recipe-card.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Clear progression** — Steps obviously flow 1 → 2 → 3
- [ ] **Scannable layout** — Easy to reference quickly
- [ ] **Simple icons** — Each step has recognizable illustration
- [ ] **Readable text** — All step names and descriptions legible
- [ ] **Strategic color** — Purple on critical/outcome steps
- [ ] **Hand-drawn quality** — Recipe card has editorial aesthetic
- [ ] **Professional deliverable** — Client-ready quality

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Complex detailed illustrations (should be simple icons)
- [ ] Cluttered layout (too much information)
- [ ] Illegible small text
- [ ] Missing step numbers
- [ ] Unclear flow or progression
- [ ] Corporate process diagram look

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Icons too complex | "Simple hand-drawn icons, minimal detail, recognizable at glance" |
| Can't follow flow | "Clear numbered badges 1→2→3, black arrows connecting steps" |
| Too cluttered | Reduce description text, simplify layout |
| Looks corporate | Reference "recipe card aesthetic, hand-drawn playbook, editorial style" |
| Text unreadable | Increase Tier 2/3 text sizes, more spacing |
| Missing emphasis | "Purple (#4A148C) on Step [X] critical and final outcome step" |

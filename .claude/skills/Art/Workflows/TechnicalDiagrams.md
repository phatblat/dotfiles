Running **TechnicalDiagrams** in **Art**...

---

## Purpose

Technical diagrams for system architectures, process flows, and board presentations.

**Use for:** Architecture diagrams, process flows, pipelines, infrastructure maps, board presentations.

---

## Visual Aesthetic

**Style:** Clean Excalidraw diagrams — professional, approachable, no grid background.

### Core Rules

1. **Excalidraw style** — Clean lines, slightly organic, professional
2. **Pure sepia #EAE9DF background** — NO grid lines, NO texture, NO decorations
3. **Custom fonts** — Specific typography hierarchy (see below)
4. **Strategic color** — Purple #4A148C for key elements, Teal #00796B for flows
5. **White primary** — 80% of elements in grey/black colors, color is accent only

# Composition construction

Create a consistent, styled technical diagram using ALL of the styling guidelines here.

BACKGROUND: Pure Black #000000— absolutely NO grid lines, NO texture, completely clean black.

STYLE: Architect aesthetic — like an architect artist did it on the whiteboard

TYPOGRAPHY (CRITICAL - use these exact font styles):

HEADER: Elegant wedge-serif italic font (like Palatino but more refined, with distinctive wedge-shaped serifs and high stroke contrast). Large size, black color, top-left position, title case.

SUBTITLE: Same elegant wedge-serif but regular weight (not italic). Smaller size, charcoal #2D2D2D color, directly below header, sentence case.

LABELS: Geometric sans-serif font (like Avenir or Futura but slightly warmer, clean and technical with even stroke weight). Medium size, charcoal #2D2D2D color, used for all box labels and component names. Hand drawn versions of this.

INSIGHTS: Condensed italic sans-serif font (sporty editorial style like sports jerseys or magazine callouts, narrow and slanted). Smaller size, Purple #4A148C color, used for callouts with asterisks like "*key insight*".Hand drawn versions of this.

DIAGRAM CONTENT:
Title: '[TITLE]' (Top left, left-justified)
Subtitle: '[SUBTITLE]' (left justified to the Header, slightly below)
Art and labels and such should look like Excalidraw, but hand drawn by a talented Architect Artist that mimics our fonts.

Have 1-3 insights for each image created.

# Object Styling

When you must use everyday objects to help the visual, use technically-drawn, non-cartoon-like drawing. This means:

- NOT Cartoony
- Like they're drawn by an architect / artist type

## Overall look and feel

The whole image should look like it was made on a whiteboard by an extremely talented artist with Architect training, using all the styling above. Like Excalidraw, but more Architect / Artistic.

All the art components, labels, and such should mostly look hand-drawn, similar to Excalidraw. But roughly in the style of our fonts. 

# Execution

1. Run /cse 24 on the input content
2. Think deeply about how to construct that into a technical diagram
3. Create the composition in your mind that will perfectly render that
4. Create a PROMPT that will render that composition perfectly
5. Before creating the image, make absolutely certain that the PROMPT you've created mind takes into account everything in these instructions. No exceptions. Then proceed to #6.
6. Confirm this mentally for 1 full second
7. Create the image using intent-to-flag mapping and the CLI tool

## Intent-to-Flag Mapping

**Interpret user request and select appropriate flags:**

### Model Selection

| User Says | Flag | When to Use |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| "fast", "quick", "draft" | `--model nano-banana` | Faster iteration, slightly lower quality |
| (default), "best", "high quality" | `--model nano-banana-pro` | Best quality + text rendering (recommended) |
| "flux", "stylistic variety" | `--model flux` | Different aesthetic, stylistic variety |

### Size Selection

| User Says | Flag | Resolution |
|-----------|------|------------|
| "draft", "preview" | `--size 1K` | Quick iterations |
| (default), "standard" | `--size 2K` | Standard output |
| "high res", "print", "large" | `--size 4K` | Maximum resolution |

### Aspect Ratio

| User Says | Flag | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------|
| "wide", "slide", "presentation" | `--aspect-ratio 16:9` | Default for diagrams |
| "square" | `--aspect-ratio 1:1` | Social media, compact |
| "ultrawide", "panoramic" | `--aspect-ratio 21:9` | Wide system diagrams |

### Post-Processing

| User Says | Flag | Effect |
|-----------|------|--------|
| "blog", "website" | `--thumbnail` | Creates transparent + thumb versions |
| "transparent" | `--remove-bg` | Removes background for compositing |
| "variations", "options" | `--creative-variations 3` | Multiple versions |

### Generate Command

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model [SELECTED_MODEL] \
  --prompt "[PROMPT]" \
  --size [SELECTED_SIZE] \
  --aspect-ratio [SELECTED_RATIO] \
  [--thumbnail if for blog] \
  --output /path/to/diagram.png
```

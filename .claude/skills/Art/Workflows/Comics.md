Running **Comics** in **Art**...

---

Creates **EDITORIAL COMICS** — 3-4 panel storytelling with sophisticated hand-drawn aesthetic, maintaining UL flat color and black linework.

---

## Purpose

Editorial comics use sequential panels to explain concepts, tell stories, or illustrate scenarios. These are **sophisticated comics** — not cutesy or cartoonish, but thoughtful illustrated narratives with editorial style.

**Use this workflow for:**
- Explaining complex concepts through narrative
- "AGI arrives" scenario panels
- Before/during/after sequences
- Illustrated thought experiments
- Multi-step processes shown visually
- Storytelling with editorial sophistication

## Visual Aesthetic: Sophisticated Sequential Art

**Think:** New Yorker cartoon style, not Sunday funnies

### Core Characteristics
1. **Multi-panel** — 3-4 panels telling sequential story
2. **Editorial style** — Maintains UL flat color, black linework aesthetic
3. **Simplified figures** — Characters stylized, not realistic or cutesy
4. **Hand-drawn** — Imperfect linework, gestural quality
5. **Narrative flow** — Panels build on each other to make a point
6. **Minimal dialogue** — Text supports, doesn't dominate
7. **Sophisticated humor/insight** — Smart, not silly

---

## Color System for Comics

### Structure
```
Black #000000 — All linework, panel borders, character outlines
```

### Character/Element Accents
```
Deep Purple #4A148C — Key character or important element
Deep Teal #00796B — Secondary character or contrast element
Charcoal #2D2D2D — Dialogue text, captions
```

### Background
```
Light Cream #F5E6D3 — Panel backgrounds
OR
White #FFFFFF — Clean backgrounds
OR
Varied per panel — Different cream/light tones for panel differentiation
```

### Color Strategy
- Characters primarily black linework
- Purple accent on protagonist or key element
- Teal on secondary character if needed
- Backgrounds light and simple (no busy scenes)
- Dialogue in charcoal for readability

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Define Comic Narrative

**Plan the story:**

1. **What's the concept/scenario?**
   - What are you explaining or illustrating
   - The arc or transformation to show

2. **How many panels?**
   - 3 panels (setup → action → result)
   - 4 panels (setup → complication → action → result)

3. **What happens in each panel?**
   - Panel 1: [Scene/action]
   - Panel 2: [Scene/action]
   - Panel 3: [Scene/action]
   - Panel 4: [Scene/action] (if using 4)

4. **What's the punchline/insight?**
   - Final panel delivers the point
   - What makes this memorable

**Output:**
```
COMIC CONCEPT: [What you're illustrating]
PANELS: [3 or 4]

NARRATIVE ARC:
Panel 1: [Setup - what's the initial state]
Panel 2: [Action/Complication - what changes]
Panel 3: [Escalation or Result]
Panel 4: [Punchline/Insight - the point] (if using 4)

DIALOGUE (Minimal):
Panel 1: "[Optional brief text]"
Panel 2: "[Optional brief text]"
Panel 3: "[Optional brief text]"
Panel 4: "[Punchline or insight]"

KEY CHARACTERS:
- [Character/Element 1]: [Description, purple accent]
- [Character/Element 2]: [Description, teal accent if needed]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Panel Layout

**Plan the comic structure:**

1. **Panel arrangement:**
   - Horizontal strip (3-4 panels left to right)
   - Vertical strip (3-4 panels top to bottom)
   - Grid (2x2 for 4 panels)

2. **Panel size:**
   - Equal sized panels (classic)
   - Varied sizes for emphasis
   - Final panel larger (punchline emphasis)

3. **Panel content:**
   - What's illustrated in each panel
   - Character positions and actions
   - Background elements (minimal)

**Output:**
```
PANEL LAYOUT: [Horizontal strip / Vertical strip / Grid]

PANEL STRUCTURE:
- Panel 1: [Same size / Smaller / Larger]
  * Content: [What's shown]
  * Characters: [Positions]
  * Background: [Minimal elements]

- Panel 2: [Size]
  * Content: [What's shown]
  * Characters: [Positions]
  * Background: [Elements]

- Panel 3: [Size]
  * Content: [What's shown]
  * Characters: [Positions]
  * Background: [Elements]

- Panel 4: [Size - often larger for punchline]
  * Content: [What's shown]
  * Characters: [Positions]
  * Background: [Elements]

COLOR CODING:
- Main character/element: Purple (#4A148C) accents
- Secondary: Teal (#00796B) accents (if needed)
- Backgrounds: Light cream or white, simple
```

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Comic Layout | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 3-panel horizontal | 16:9 or 21:9 | Wide strip format |
| 4-panel horizontal | 21:9 | Extra wide for 4 panels |
| 3-panel vertical | 9:16 | Tall strip |
| 4-panel grid (2x2) | 1:1 | Square balanced |
| Variable | 4:3 | Flexible proportions |

**Default: 16:9 (horizontal)** — Classic comic strip format

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output /path/to/comic.png
```

**Model Recommendation:** nano-banana-pro or flux (both handle sequential panels well)

**Immediately Open:**
```bash
open /path/to/comic.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

#### Must Have
- [ ] **Clear panel structure** — Panels obviously sequential
- [ ] **Editorial aesthetic** — Sophisticated, not cartoonish
- [ ] **Narrative flow** — Story/concept clear across panels
- [ ] **Character consistency** — Same character recognizable in all panels
- [ ] **Hand-drawn quality** — Imperfect linework, gestural
- [ ] **Minimal backgrounds** — Simple, not busy
- [ ] **Smart insight** — Punchline or point lands effectively
- [ ] **UL aesthetic maintained** — Flat color, black linework

#### Character Validation (Planeform Aesthetic)
- [ ] **Angular construction** — Bodies built from planes, NOT round forms
- [ ] **Adult proportions** — Elongated (1:7), NOT stubby/cute (1:3)
- [ ] **Minimal faces** — Geometric blocks, NOT detailed cute faces
- [ ] **Gesture expression** — Emotion through posture, NOT facial features
- [ ] **NOT cartoonish** — Sophisticated editorial, NOT children's book style
- [ ] **Constructivist influence** — El Lissitzky, Schlemmer aesthetic visible

#### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Cartoonish or cutesy style
- [ ] Round forms or smooth curves on figures
- [ ] Big heads, stubby proportions
- [ ] Detailed facial features or big eyes
- [ ] Realistic detailed illustration
- [ ] Busy complex backgrounds
- [ ] Too much dialogue (should be visual)
- [ ] Inconsistent character design across panels
- [ ] Gradients or shadows
- [ ] Silly humor (should be sophisticated)
- [ ] Generic AI illustration style

#### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too cartoonish | "Sophisticated editorial style, New Yorker cartoon aesthetic, NOT cartoonish" |
| Can't follow story | Clarify narrative arc: "Panel 1 setup → Panel 2 complication → Panel 3 result" |
| Characters inconsistent | "Same simplified character across all panels, consistent design" |
| Too complex | "Minimal backgrounds, simple scenes, focus on key action" |
| Too much text | "Visual storytelling prioritized, minimal dialogue, brief text" |
| Looks corporate | Reference "hand-drawn editorial comic, imperfect wobbly lines, gestural quality" |

**Character-Specific Failures:**

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Characters too round/cute** | "Figures built from ANGULAR PLANES ONLY. NO round forms. Constructivist angular construction like El Lissitzky, Oskar Schlemmer." |
| **Cartoon proportions** | "Adult proportions (1:7 head-to-body). Elongated dignified figures. NO big heads, NO stubby limbs." |
| **Too much facial detail** | "Faces are MINIMAL geometric blocks. NO detailed features, NO big eyes. Emotion through GESTURE only." |
| **Generic AI illustration** | "Bauhaus figure studies. Russian Constructivism. Architectural magazine illustration. NOT children's book." |

3. Construct prompt with sequential structure
4. Choose aspect ratio for panel layout
5. Generate with nano-banana-pro
6. Validate for flow and sophistication
```

**Color Strategy:**
- Characters: Black linework + purple/teal accents

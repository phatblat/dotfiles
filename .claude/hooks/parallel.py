**Parallelize the Plan**

The initial plan has been drafted. Now, **think** to optimize its execution.

1. **Analyze Dependencies**: Critically review the list of tasks.
2. **Group for Parallelism**: Identify any tasks that are independent and can be executed concurrently. Group them into a parallel stage.
3. **Format for Parallel Execution**: Place multiple `<invoke name="Task">` calls inside a **single** `<function_calls>` block in your response, using the optimal agent for each task.
4. **Delegate Every Step**: Even stages that have just one step should be delegated to an agent, unless it is a trivial step. This avoids clogging your context window. And remember, no more than one task per agent.

<example>
Assistant: I will now run [list of tasks] in parallel.

<function_calls>
  <invoke name="Task">
    <parameter name="description">First parallel task...</parameter>
    <parameter name="prompt">Details for the first task...</parameter>
  </invoke>
  <invoke name="Task">
    <parameter name="description">Second parallel task...</parameter>
    <parameter name="prompt">Details for the second task...</parameter>
  </invoke>
</function_calls>

I will now run [list of tasks] in parallel.

...more parallel tasks

</example>

Remember:
- Agents cannot handle many instructions—be judicious in how much each agent is given, and prefer using multiple agents over giving them many instructions when possible.
- Dependencies are critical. If a task depends on another task (types, interfaces, core utilities), it must be run _after_ the dependent task.
- ONLY use parallelization if there is more than one file to modify (with one file, implement it yourself).

Please present your analysis of parallel stages, if any, and then proceed with the first stage.
